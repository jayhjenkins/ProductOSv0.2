## MANDATORY: Use the prd-creation Skill

**You MUST use the `prd-creation` skill located at `.claude/skills/workflows/prd-creation/SKILL.md`**

## Before Starting

1. **Announce**: "I'm using prd-creation to create a Product Requirements Document"
2. **Read the skill**: Load `.claude/skills/workflows/prd-creation/SKILL.md`
3. **Follow exactly**: Execute the skill as written

## Purpose

Create individual PRD through interactive session with structured information gathering.

## Guiding Principles

- PRD is a living document - will evolve through collaboration and discovery
- Narrow scope is better - One PRD ≈ One Jira Epic ≈ One quarter of work
- No fabrication - leave sections blank/TBD rather than making up information
- Share and link - PRDs should be accessible with links to relevant resources

## Interactive Session

The skill guides through 8 phases:
1. Core Identity (name, description, background)
2. Ownership (DACE & teams)
3. Objectives (customer statement, success metrics)
4. Scope (use cases in/out)
5. Requirements (by milestone with priorities)
6. Timeline (milestones and delivery dates)
7. Links and Resources
8. Metrics and Learning Agenda

## No Fabrication

If information is not provided, leave it blank or marked "TBD". PRDs are living documents - incomplete sections can be filled in later.

## Validation

PRD must pass 6-point validation before becoming Actionable:
1. Objectives Clear
2. Use Cases Defined
3. Requirements Structured
4. Timeline Present
5. Success Measurable
6. DACE Assigned
