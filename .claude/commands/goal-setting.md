## MANDATORY: Use the goal-setting Skill

**You MUST use the `goal-setting` skill located at `.claude/skills/workflows/goal-setting/SKILL.md`**

## Before Starting

1. **Announce**: "I'm using goal-setting to establish metric targets"
2. **Read the skill**: Load `.claude/skills/workflows/goal-setting/SKILL.md`
3. **Follow exactly**: Execute the skill as written

## Purpose

Establish ambitious but realistic targets for defined metrics by validating team's ability to move the metric and evaluating trade-offs between aggressive and conservative goals.

## Required Inputs

- Metric and current baseline
- Historical trends (seasonality, growth rate)
- Planned initiatives with estimated impacts
- Comparison benchmarks (if available)
- Company-level targets and goals
- Resource constraints

## Workflow Sequence

1. North Star Alignment → How much movement matters to company goals?
2. Proxy Metric Selection → Validate metric is movable by team
3. Trade-off Evaluation → Cost of aggressive vs conservative targets
4. Set Final Goal → Synthesize into clear target

## Target Levels

- **Conservative:** 90%+ confidence, proven tactics
- **Ambitious:** 60-70% confidence, stretch but achievable
- **Moonshot:** 20-30% confidence, requires everything + surprises

## Output

- Target value or % improvement
- Timeframe
- Confidence level (committed vs aspirational)
- Dependencies and assumptions
- Intermediate milestones
- Success criteria
- Review cadence

## Time Estimate

65-75 minutes total

## No Rationalization

Reality-check against historical trends. Validate initiatives exist to support target.
