## MANDATORY: Use the dashboard-design Skill

**You MUST use the `dashboard-design` skill located at `.claude/skills/workflows/dashboard-design/SKILL.md`**

## Before Starting

1. **Announce**: "I'm using dashboard-design to create a product health dashboard"
2. **Read the skill**: Load `.claude/skills/workflows/dashboard-design/SKILL.md`
3. **Follow exactly**: Execute the skill as written

## Purpose

Design structured recurring dashboard covering full user lifecycle with balanced metrics, counter-metrics, and review cadence.

## Required Inputs

- Company/product mission statement
- Business model type
- User lifecycle stages for this product
- Existing metrics (if any) and gaps
- Key stakeholder questions dashboard should answer
- Desired review cadence

## Workflow Sequence

1. North Star Alignment → Anchor to company mission
2. Funnel-Based Metric Mapping → Coverage across lifecycle stages
3. Proxy Metric Selection → Measurable indicators per stage
4. Trade-off Evaluation → Include counter-metrics
5. Dashboard Assembly → Structure, cadence, alerts, ownership

## Output

- Dashboard structure organized by funnel stage
- 5-10 metrics with precise definitions
- 2-3 counter-metrics
- Review cadence (daily/weekly/monthly)
- Alert thresholds
- Metric ownership assigned

## Dashboard Principles

- Comprehensive but focused (5-10 metrics)
- Leading + lagging indicators
- Volume + quality metrics
- Counter-metrics for unintended effects

## Time Estimate

85-100 minutes total

## No Rationalization

Cover all lifecycle stages systematically. No single-metric dashboards.
