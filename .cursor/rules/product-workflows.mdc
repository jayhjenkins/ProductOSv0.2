# Product Workflows

## Workflow: Product Planning (meetings-to-backlog)

**Purpose**: Transform meeting signals into actionable PRDs.

**When to Use**: Processing meeting transcripts to extract roadmap items.

### Inputs
- `days`: Lookback window (default: 3 days or from last run)
- `include_customers`: Filter to specific customers
- `min_mentions`, `min_sources`: Signal thresholds
- `exclude_types`: Skip signal types (default: "bugs,housekeeping")

### Steps

1. **Determine Time Window**
   - Check `datasets/product/.meetings-to-backlog-state.json` for last run
   - Calculate cutoff date

2. **Synthesize Meeting Signals**
   - Invoke meeting-synthesis (see context-assembly rules)
   - Extract feature requests, pain points, integration gaps
   - Cluster signals into themes

3. **Filter to PRD-Level Candidates**
   - Apply PRD scope rubric (see quality-gates rules)
   - Keep candidates that are outcome-oriented, quarterly-scoped, bounded, actionable, measurable, evidence-backed
   - Drop items too small (tickets) or too large (initiatives spanning multiple quarters)

4. **Draft PRD Proposals**
   - Structure using PRD template from `datasets/product/templates/prd-template.md`
   - Include signal evidence with customer names and dates
   - Set initial status: 🚧 Drafting

5. **Validate Each PRD**
   - Apply 6-point rubric via PRD-validation gate
   - PASS → continue; FAIL → refine or drop

6. **Deduplicate Against Existing Backlog**
   - Check `datasets/product/backlog.md` for similar PRDs
   - Merge or supersede as appropriate

7. **Output PRD Proposals**
   - Prepend to `datasets/product/backlog.md`
   - Write individual files to `datasets/product/prds/{YYYY}/PRD_{slug}.md`

8. **Update State Tracking**
   - Write timestamp to `datasets/product/.meetings-to-backlog-state.json`

### Output Locations
- `datasets/product/backlog.md` — Updated backlog
- `datasets/product/prds/{YYYY}/PRD_{slug}.md` — Individual PRD files

## Workflow: PRD Creation (standalone)

**Purpose**: Create individual PRD through interactive session.

**When to Use**: Creating a single PRD from specific input or user request.

### Guiding Principles

1. **PRD is a living document** — It will evolve through collaboration and discovery
2. **Narrow scope is better** — One PRD ≈ One Jira Epic ≈ One quarter of work
3. **Share and link** — PRDs should be accessible with links to Slack channels
4. **No fabrication** — Leave sections blank/TBD rather than making up information
5. **Reflect what was delivered** — At close, PRD should document actual outcomes

### Interactive Session Steps

#### Phase 1: Core Identity
Gather from user:
- **Project Name**: What is this PRD called?
- **One-liner Description**: 1-3 sentence summary for quick context
- **Background**: Why does this project exist? What problem does it solve?

#### Phase 2: Ownership (DACE)
Gather from user:
- **Driver**: Who is driving this initiative?
- **Approver**: Who has final approval authority?
- **Contributors**: Who is contributing to the work?
- **Escalation Path**: Where to escalate blockers or decisions?
- **Driving Teams**: Which teams own this work? (PM, PMO, Engineering, Design roles)
- **Contributing Teams**: Which teams are contributing?
- **Other Stakeholders**: Legal, Security, etc.

*If user doesn't know, leave as TBD.*

#### Phase 3: Objectives
Gather from user:
- **Target Customer/User**: Who is this for?
- **Customer Statement**:
  - I am: (narrow description of customer with motivations/attributes)
  - I'm trying to: (desired outcome)
  - But: (problem/barrier)
  - Because: (root cause)
  - Which makes me feel: (emotion)
- **Success Metrics**: How will we measure success?
- **Opportunity Sizing**: What's the potential impact?

*Source from meeting signals if available. Leave blank if not known.*

#### Phase 4: Scope
Gather from user:
- **Use Cases In Scope**: What specific use cases will be supported?
- **Out of Scope**: What are we explicitly NOT doing? Why?

*Be specific. Think through edge cases.*

#### Phase 5: Requirements
For each milestone, gather:
- **Milestone Name/Summary**
- **Requirements** with:
  - Priority (P0/P1/P2)
  - Dependent Teams
  - User Story format: "In order to accomplish X, we will build Y"
  - Acceptance Criteria: How we know requirements are met
  - Figma links (if available)
  - JIRA tickets (if available)

*Only include requirements that are known. Don't fabricate.*

#### Phase 6: Timeline
Gather from user:
- **Milestones**: List of major milestones
- **Expected Delivery Timeline**: Target dates for each milestone
- **Teams Leading Each Phase**

*If timeline is not yet determined, leave as TBD.*

#### Phase 7: Links and Resources
Gather from user:
- **Slack Channels**
- **Figma/Design Links**
- **Architecture/Technical Design Docs**
- **JIRA Project/Tracking Links**
- **Any Other Relevant Links**

*Only include links that exist. Don't create placeholder URLs.*

#### Phase 8: Metrics and Learning Agenda
Gather from user:
- **Goals and Hypotheses**: What do you want to happen?
- **Signals**: What would indicate success?
- **Metrics**: What to measure?

### Fact-Checking Requirements

**CRITICAL**: Do not fabricate information. For any section where information is not provided:
- Leave the section blank or marked "TBD"
- Note in changelog that section needs input
- Ask user if they have the information available

### PRD Statuses

| Status | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| 🚧 Drafting | Initial creation, known to be incomplete |
| 🏃 Actionable | Eng has agreed there's enough to start work |
| 🔒 Closed | Represents what was finally delivered |
| ❗ Abandoned | Project cancelled or superseded |

### Validation
- Apply 6-point PRD validation rubric before finalizing
- Drafting PRDs may have validation warnings but not blockers
- Actionable PRDs must pass all validation criteria

### Output
- Location: `datasets/product/prds/{YYYY}/PRD_{slug}.md`
- Use template: `datasets/product/templates/prd-template.md`
- Add changelog entry with creation date

---

## Workflow: Roadmap Updating

**Purpose**: Update roadmap with newly validated PRDs.

**When to Use**: After PRD validation to sequence items on roadmap.

### Steps

1. **Load Current Roadmap**
   - Read `datasets/product/roadmap.md`

2. **Create Snapshot**
   - Copy to `datasets/product/snapshots/ROADMAP_{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`

3. **Insert New PRDs**
   - Add validated PRDs at appropriate position based on timeline
   - Update changelog section

4. **Write Updated Roadmap**
   - Save to `datasets/product/roadmap.md`

## Workflow: CS Prep (Customer Success Preparation)

**Purpose**: Compile customer context for QBR or strategic CS meetings.

**When to Use**: Preparing for customer quarterly business reviews.

### Inputs
- `customer`: Customer name (required)
- `days`: Lookback window (default: 90)

### Steps

1. **Synthesize Customer Meetings**
   - Filter meetings to specified customer only
   - Extract all signals (no thresholds)

2. **Organize by Category**
   - **Wins**: Positive feedback, success stories
   - **Pain Points**: Friction, challenges, blockers
   - **Feature Requests**: Asks for new capabilities
   - **Onboarding/Setup**: Implementation challenges

3. **Extract Key Quotes**
   - Select 2-3 most impactful quotes per category
   - Include speaker, date, context

4. **Build Timeline**
   - Feature request timeline with dates

5. **Generate CS Brief**
   ```markdown
   # QBR Brief: {Customer}

   **Date**: {YYYY-MM-DD}
   **Time Window**: Last {N} days
   **Meetings Reviewed**: {N}

   ## Wins
   - {Quote/signal}

   ## Pain Points
   - {Quote/signal}

   ## Feature Requests
   - {Request} (mentioned {N} times)

   ## Timeline of Key Events
   - {Date}: {Event}

   ## Recommended Discussion Topics
   1. {Topic}
   ```

### Output Location
- `datasets/product/customer-briefs/{Customer}_{YYYYMMDD}_qbr.md`
