# Quality Gates

Quality gates are **non-negotiable validation checks** that must pass before proceeding.

---

## Gate: PRD Validation (6-Point Rubric)

**Purpose**: Ensure all PRDs maintain consistent quality standards.

**When Applied**: Before any PRD transitions from Drafting to Actionable status.

### The Iron Law

**NO PRD BECOMES ACTIONABLE WITHOUT PASSING ALL 6 RUBRIC CHECKS**

If a PRD fails any criterion, it must be:
1. Refined until it passes, OR
2. Demoted to a ticket (if too small for a PRD), OR
3. Split into multiple PRDs (if too large for one quarter), OR
4. Kept in Drafting status (if information is pending)

### The 6 Criteria

#### 1. Objectives Clear
PRD has a well-defined customer statement with problem and desired outcome.

| Pass ✓ | Fail ✗ |
|--------|--------|
| Complete "I am / I'm trying to / But / Because / Which makes me feel" | Only vague problem statement |
| Specific customer description with motivations | "Users need this feature" |
| Clear desired outcome articulated | Missing success criteria |

#### 2. Use Cases Defined
PRD has explicit in-scope use cases with descriptions.

| Pass ✓ | Fail ✗ |
|--------|--------|
| 2+ specific use cases documented | No use cases listed |
| Each use case has a description | Only bullet points without context |
| Out-of-scope items explicitly stated | "Out of scope: TBD" |

#### 3. Requirements Structured
PRD has requirements organized by milestone with priority levels.

| Pass ✓ | Fail ✗ |
|--------|--------|
| Requirements grouped by milestone | Flat list of requirements |
| Each requirement has P0/P1/P2 priority | No prioritization |
| Acceptance criteria defined | Vague or missing acceptance criteria |
| User story format used | Just feature descriptions |

#### 4. Timeline Present
PRD has milestones with expected delivery timeline.

| Pass ✓ | Fail ✗ |
|--------|--------|
| Milestones table populated | No timeline section |
| Expected delivery dates/quarters | "Timeline: TBD" |
| Teams assigned to milestones | No ownership identified |

#### 5. Success Measurable
PRD has success metrics and/or opportunity sizing.

| Pass ✓ | Fail ✗ |
|--------|--------|
| Specific metrics identified | "We'll know it when we see it" |
| Signals for success defined | No measurement plan |
| Opportunity sizing included (if applicable) | Impact not quantified |

#### 6. DACE Assigned
PRD has Driver, Approver, and key Contributors identified.

| Pass ✓ | Fail ✗ |
|--------|--------|
| Driver clearly identified | "Driver: TBD" |
| Approver assigned | No approval authority |
| At least one driving team with roles | No team ownership |
| Escalation path defined | No escalation plan |

### Validation by PRD Status

| Status | Validation Requirement |
|--------|----------------------|
| 🚧 Drafting | Warnings allowed, no blockers. Must have: Project name, description, at least one objective |
| 🏃 Actionable | **ALL 6 criteria must pass**. No TBD in critical fields |
| 🔒 Closed | All criteria passed + reflects actual delivery |
| ❗ Abandoned | No validation required |

### Validation Report Format

```markdown
# PRD Validation Report: [PASS/FAIL]

**PRD**: [Title]
**Current Status**: [Status]
**Target Status**: [Drafting/Actionable/Closed]

✓/✗ Objectives Clear: [assessment]
✓/✗ Use Cases Defined: [N] in-scope, [N] out-of-scope
✓/✗ Requirements Structured: [N] milestones, [N] requirements
✓/✗ Timeline Present: [assessment]
✓/✗ Success Measurable: [N] metrics defined
✓/✗ DACE Assigned: Driver: [name], Approver: [name]

**Recommendation**: [Approve for Actionable / Needs Revision / Keep as Draft]

**Required Actions** (if any):
- [Action item 1]
- [Action item 2]
```

---

## Gate: Citation Compliance

**Purpose**: Ensure all factual claims are properly sourced.

**When Applied**: Before publishing strategy memos, research documents, or evidence-backed artifacts.

### Requirements

1. **Every factual claim requires a source reference**
   - Link to specific document path
   - Include verbatim quote (5-25 words)

2. **Citation Format**
   ```markdown
   [^1]: path/to/source.md: "Exact verbatim quote from source"
   ```

3. **Verbatim Quote Standards**
   - 5-25 words
   - Exact wording from source
   - Supports the specific claim made

4. **Validation Process**
   - Read each cited source
   - Confirm quote exists verbatim
   - Verify quote supports the claim

### Failure Conditions

- "(source needed)" marker present → **FAIL**
- Quote not found in source → **FAIL**
- Quote doesn't support claim → **FAIL**
- Missing citation for factual claim → **FAIL**

---

## Gate: Source Integrity

**Purpose**: Validate research source quality and freshness.

**When Applied**: When gathering research context.

### Checks

1. **Metadata Completeness**
   - Title, source_type, date_added present
   - Expiry date set appropriately

2. **Expiry Status**
   - Not past expiry date (or explicitly flagged)
   - Freshness appropriate for content type

3. **Content Structure**
   - Key Insights section present
   - Strategic Applications section present
   - Citation-ready quotes included

---

## Gate: Meeting Schema Validation

**Purpose**: Ensure meeting files have proper structure for synthesis.

**When Applied**: Before processing meetings for signals.

### Required Elements

1. **YAML Frontmatter**
   ```yaml
   ---
   date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
   type: "sales|product|customersuccess|..."
   customer: "Company Name"
   participants: ["Person"]
   ---
   ```

2. **Required Sections**
   - AI Summary (recommended)
   - Action Items or Full Transcript

### Validation

- Missing date → **WARN** (skip meeting)
- Missing customer for external → **WARN**
- No content sections → **SKIP**

## Anti-Rationalization Blocks

Common excuses explicitly rejected:

| Rationalization | Reality |
|-----------------|---------|
| "We can fill in details later" | Actionable PRDs need complete critical fields |
| "Everyone knows what this means" | Make it explicit and testable |
| "This is obviously valuable" | Show metrics and opportunity sizing |
| "Out of scope is implied" | Explicitly state exclusions |
| "Close enough to pass" | All criteria or remain in Draft |
| "Source is close enough" | Verbatim quotes only |
| "We'll figure out timeline later" | Timeline required for Actionable status |
| "DACE can be assigned later" | Driver and Approver required for Actionable |
