# Research Workflows

## Research Topics

Sources are organized by strategic category:

| Topic | Contents |
|-------|----------|
| `competitive-analysis` | Competitor capabilities, positioning, pricing |
| `pricing-strategy` | Pricing models, packaging, value perception |
| `market-positioning` | Market trends, customer segments, messaging |
| `product-strategy` | Feature prioritization, roadmap direction |
| `customer-segmentation` | Audience targeting, persona development |
| `growth-strategy` | Acquisition, retention, expansion tactics |

---

## Workflow: Research Gathering

**Purpose**: Assemble relevant research context for strategic sessions.

**When to Use**: Before strategy sessions, when building evidence for decisions.

### Inputs
- `topic`: Strategic category (required)
- `max_age_days`: Maximum source age (optional)
- `include_expired`: Whether to include expired sources (default: false)
- `keywords`: Additional keyword filter (optional)

### Expiry Guidelines

| Source Type | Default Max Age | Rationale |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Frameworks | 365-730 days | Conceptual models change slowly |
| Market data | 90-180 days | Markets evolve quickly |
| Competitor intel | 180-365 days | Products/pricing shift |
| Customer insights | 180-365 days | Needs evolve over time |

### Steps

1. **Collect Research Files**
   - Scan: `datasets/research/sources/{topic}/**/*.md`

2. **Filter by Recency and Expiry**
   - Read frontmatter: `added_utc`, `expiry_date`
   - Calculate age, check expiry
   - Flag expired sources with "[EXPIRED]"

3. **Extract Key Information**
   - `## Key Insights` → Primary takeaways
   - `## Strategic Applications` → How to use
   - `## Citations / Quotes` → Verbatim quotes for citation
   - `## Related Internal Links` → Connected context

4. **Apply Keyword Filters** (if provided)
   - Search across title, insights, quotes, tags

5. **Generate Gathering Report**

   ```markdown
   # Research Gathering Report

   **Topic**: {topic}
   **Sources Found**: {N total}
   **Active Sources**: {N non-expired}
   **Expired Sources**: {N expired}

   ## Active Sources

   ### Source 1: {Title}
   - **Added**: {date} ({N} days ago)
   - **Expires**: {date}
   - **Path**: {file_path}

   **Key Insights:**
   - Insight 1
   - Insight 2

   **Notable Quotes:**
   > "Quote text"
   > — Author, Source

   ---

   ## Expired Sources (Require Refresh)

   ### Source 3: {Title} [EXPIRED]
   - **Recommendation**: Refresh or archive
   ```

---

## Workflow: Research Processing

**Purpose**: Process external sources into standardized research format.

**When to Use**: Adding new research from URLs, files, or chat sessions.

### Input Types

**URL Processing:**
- Fetch web content
- Convert to standardized markdown
- Extract key insights and frameworks
- Add citation-ready quotes

**File Processing:**
- Process PDFs, docs, reports
- Extract text and key concepts
- Create structured source document

**Chat Session Processing:**
- Capture current conversation insights
- Extract strategic decisions discussed
- Create reusable research artifact

### Source Document Format

```markdown
---
title: "[Source Title]"
source_type: "website|pdf|report|chat-session|framework"
source_url: "[URL if applicable]"
date_added: "[YYYY-MM-DD]"
date_expires: "[YYYY-MM-DD]"
topic: "[strategic-topic]"
relevance_tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
data_confidence: "high|medium|low"
---

# [Source Title]

**Source**: [Author/Organization]
**Original URL/Location**: [If applicable]
**Date Published**: [Original date]
**Data Confidence**: [High/Medium/Low with justification]

## Key Insights

[Strategic insights that directly inform decisions]

## Strategic Applications

[How this applies to decision-making context]

## Key Quotes/Data Points

> "Verbatim quote for citation"
> — Author, Source (Date)

## Related Internal Context

[Links to relevant meetings, roadmap items, other sources]

## Notes

[Thoughts, connections to other research]
```

### Output Location
- `datasets/research/sources/{topic}/{filename}.md`

---

## Source Quality Standards

### Data Confidence Levels

| Level | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| High | Authoritative source, recent data, verified methodology |
| Medium | Reliable source but some limitations (age, scope) |
| Low | Useful insights but significant limitations |

### Citation Requirements

- Preserve verbatim quotes (5-25 words) for key claims
- Include source attribution
- Format for easy citation in memos
- Track original source URL/location

### Expiry Management

- Set appropriate expiry based on content type
- Flag sources approaching expiry
- Recommend refresh for stale data
- Archive sources no longer relevant
