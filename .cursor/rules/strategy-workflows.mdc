# Strategy Workflows

## Workflow: Strategy Session

**Purpose**: Conduct systematic strategic decision-making with research-backed analysis.

**When to Use**: Strategic decision needed, multiple options require evaluation.

### Inputs
- `topic`: Strategic category (competitive-analysis, pricing-strategy, product-strategy, market-positioning, etc.)
- Specific decision question
- Time horizon (tactical: 3-6 months, strategic: 12+ months)

### Steps

1. **Define Session Topic**
   - Document decision question
   - Create session folder: `datasets/strategy/sessions/{YYYY}/{MM-DD}_{topic}/`
   - Initialize `session-log.md`

2. **Gather Research Context**
   - Collect sources from `datasets/research/sources/{topic}/`
   - Filter by recency and expiry
   - Output to `{session-folder}/context.md`

3. **Synthesize Meeting Context**
   - Extract relevant customer signals (90-day window)
   - Append to `context.md`

4. **Select Decision Framework**
   
   | Decision Type | Recommended Frameworks |
   |---------------|----------------------|
   | Competitive | Porter's Five Forces, SWOT, Competitive Positioning Matrix |
   | Product | Jobs-to-be-Done, Opportunity Solution Tree, RICE |
   | Pricing | Value-Based Pricing, Price Elasticity, Competitive Pricing |
   | Market Positioning | STP, Positioning Canvas, Perceptual Mapping |
   | Organizational | Stakeholder Mapping, RACI, Change Impact Analysis |

5. **Apply Framework Rigorously**
   - Document analysis in `{session-folder}/framework.md`
   - Include specific findings with evidence
   - For Porter's Five Forces: Rate each force (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH) with factors
   - For Stakeholder Mapping: Power/Interest grid with strategies

6. **Develop Concrete Scenarios**
   - For each option:
     - Description with specifics
     - Concrete example (e.g., "Agency with 15 clients, $50k MRR")
     - Pros with evidence sources
     - Cons with risks
     - Expected impact (quantitative where possible)
     - Risk assessment (likelihood, impact, reversibility)

7. **Facilitate Trade-off Analysis**
   - Compare options across dimensions
   - Document in `session-log.md`

8. **Develop Recommendation**
   - Clear recommendation with multi-point rationale
   - Success metrics (specific, measurable, with timelines)
   - Risk management with mitigation strategies
   - Output to `{session-folder}/recommendations.md`

9. **Offer Memo Generation**
   - If user accepts, proceed to Strategy Memo workflow

### Output Files
- `context.md` — Research and meeting context
- `framework.md` — Framework application and findings
- `session-log.md` — Interactive discussion and option analysis
- `recommendations.md` — Final recommendation with rationale

### Session Quality Checklist

Before marking complete:
- [ ] Context assembled with research sources (citations ready)
- [ ] Customer/meeting signals synthesized
- [ ] Framework selected and applied rigorously
- [ ] Options developed with concrete scenarios
- [ ] Each option includes pros/cons with evidence
- [ ] Quantitative analysis where appropriate
- [ ] Trade-offs analyzed systematically
- [ ] Recommendation clear with multi-point rationale
- [ ] Success metrics specific and measurable
- [ ] Risks assessed with likelihood/impact
- [ ] Risk mitigations documented

## Workflow: Strategy Memo

**Purpose**: Generate formal strategic decision memo with full citation compliance.

**When to Use**: After strategy session completion or for standalone documentation.

### Inputs

**From Session (preferred):**
- Session folder path with completed artifacts
- All session files (context.md, framework.md, session-log.md, recommendations.md)

**Standalone:**
- Decision question
- Will invoke research-gathering and meeting-synthesis

### Steps

1. **Content Extraction** (from session artifacts)
   - Decision Question from session-log header
   - Problem Context from context.md
   - Research Evidence with citations
   - Framework Analysis from framework.md
   - Options Analysis with pros/cons
   - Recommendation from recommendations.md
   
   **Quality Check:**
   - Do NOT add content not present in session
   - Preserve quantitative data
   - Keep concrete examples

2. **Framework Integration**
   - Reference specific framework findings
   - Map insights to recommendation rationale

3. **MECE Structure Assembly**

   ```markdown
   ---
   title: "[Decision Title]"
   date: "[YYYY-MM-DD]"
   author: "[Author]"
   decision_type: "[strategic|tactical|operational]"
   topic: "[Topic]"
   status: "[draft|final]"
   stakeholders: ["[Stakeholder1]"]
   context_session: "[Session Path]"
   ---

   # [Decision Title]

   ## Problem Statement
   [1-2 sentence clear statement]

   ## Key Evidence & Analysis

   ### Research Findings
   [Insights with citations and verbatim quotes]

   ### Customer/Market Signals
   [From meeting synthesis]

   ### Framework Applied
   [Framework name and key findings]

   ### Options Considered
   [For each option: description, pros, cons, expected impact]

   ## Recommendation
   **We recommend: Option [N] - [Name]**
   
   **Rationale:**
   1. [Reason with evidence]
   2. [Reason with evidence]

   **Success Metrics:**
   | Metric | Baseline | Target | Timeline |
   |--------|----------|--------|----------|
   
   ## Risk Management
   [Risks with likelihood/impact and mitigation]

   ## Sources & Citations
   [Full references with verbatim quotes]
   ```

4. **Citation Compliance Validation**
   - All claims must have sources
   - Verbatim quotes (5-25 words) required
   - Verify all citation paths are accessible
   - No "(source needed)" markers

5. **Quality Gates**
   
   **Structure Validation:**
   - Problem statement clear (1-2 sentences)
   - Evidence includes citations
   - Framework applied
   - Options with pros/cons
   - Recommendation actionable
   - Metrics measurable
   - Risks with likelihood/impact

   **Content Validation:**
   - Quantitative data preserved
   - Concrete examples included
   - MECE structure maintained
   - No unsupported speculation
   - Strategic focus (not implementation planning)

6. **Write Memo**
   - Location: `datasets/strategy/memos/{YYYY}/{MM-DD}_{decision-slug}.md`

7. **Archive Session** (if from session)
   - Move session folder to `datasets/strategy/archive/{YYYY}/`

### Memo Quality Standards

**Always Include:**
- Problem Statement
- Key Evidence & Analysis
- Recommendation
- Risk Management
- Sources & Citations

**Include When Relevant:**
- Economic Impact Analysis (pricing, investment decisions)
- Customer/Market Scenarios (user-facing decisions)
- Competitive Implications (positioning decisions)
- Technical Requirements (product/platform decisions)

**Quality Warning Flags:**
- ❌ Narrative-focused without framework application
- ❌ High-level concepts without concrete scenarios
- ❌ Vague abstractions instead of specific numbers
- ❌ Options without trade-off analysis
- ❌ Risks without likelihood/impact ratings
- ❌ Success criteria that aren't measurable
- ❌ Implementation details mixed with strategy

- ✅ Framework-driven with specific findings
- ✅ Concrete examples with specifics
- ✅ Quantitative where appropriate
- ✅ Systematic options comparison
- ✅ Risk assessment with mitigation
- ✅ Specific, measurable metrics
