# Context Assembly

Reusable patterns for gathering and synthesizing context.

---

## Skill: Meeting Synthesis

**Purpose**: Extract actionable product signals from meeting transcripts.

**When to Use**: Product planning, CS prep, strategy sessions needing customer evidence.

### Signal Types

| Type | Indicators | Extract |
|------|------------|---------|
| Feature Requests | "We need...", "Can you build..." | Capability requested, why needed, who requested |
| Pain Points | "It's frustrating...", "We struggle..." | Pain point, workflow impact, frequency |
| Onboarding Friction | "Setup was confusing...", "Took X weeks..." | Step causing friction, time impact |
| Integration Gaps | "We use [Tool] but can't connect..." | Integration needed, data flow, workaround |
| Performance Needs | "Too slow when...", "Can't handle X records..." | Operation, current vs. needed performance |

### Process

1. **Determine Time Window**
   - From `days` parameter, or
   - From `last_run` in state file, or
   - Default: 3 days

2. **Collect Meeting Files**
   - Scan: `datasets/meetings/Customers/**/YYYY/*.md`
   - Scan: `datasets/meetings/Internal/Product/YYYY/*.md`
   - Filter by date >= cutoff

3. **Extract Signals from Each Meeting**
   - Parse YAML frontmatter (date, customer, type, participants)
   - Read sections (AI Summary, Action Items, Full Transcript)
   - Pattern match for signal indicators
   - Extract verbatim quotes

4. **Cluster Signals**
   - Group similar signals across customers
   - Label clusters with action-style names
   - Example: "Revamp onboarding to reduce TTFV"

5. **Compute Metrics**
   - Mention count (total occurrences)
   - Unique accounts (distinct customers)
   - Recency weight (newer = higher)
   - Source diversity (mix of meeting types)

### Output Structure

```json
{
  "time_window": {
    "start_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "end_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "meetings_processed": N
  },
  "clusters": [
    {
      "label": "Action-style theme name",
      "mention_count": N,
      "unique_accounts": N,
      "signals": [
        {
          "text": "Verbatim quote",
          "customer": "Company",
          "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
          "source_file": "path"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Skill: Priority Scoring

**Purpose**: Apply consistent, objective scoring for roadmap sequencing and strategic comparisons.

**When to Use**: Comparing strategic options, ranking backlog items for roadmap placement. Note: PRDs use timeline-based prioritization rather than this scoring formula.

### Formula

```
Priority Score = (0.2 × SignalStrength) + (0.4 × StrategicFit) + (0.3 × Impact) - (0.1 × Complexity)
```

Score range: 0.0 to 10.0

### Component Calculations

#### SignalStrength (20%)

```
SignalStrength = (0.4 × CustomerScore) + (0.3 × RecencyScore) + (0.2 × DiversityScore) + (0.1 × FrequencyScore)
```

| CustomerScore | Accounts |
|---------------|----------|
| 3.0 | 1 account |
| 5.0 | 2 accounts |
| 7.0 | 3 accounts |
| 9.0 | 4+ accounts |
| 10.0 | 6+ accounts |

| RecencyScore | Days Ago |
|--------------|----------|
| 10.0 | <7 days |
| 8.0 | 7-14 days |
| 6.0 | 14-30 days |
| 4.0 | 30-60 days |
| 2.0 | 60-90 days |

#### StrategicFit (40%)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 8-10 | Directly advances top-tier strategic goals |
| 5-7 | Supports goals indirectly, table-stakes feature |
| 1-4 | Tangential, one-off request |

#### Impact (30%)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 9-10 | 20%+ improvement in primary metric, unlocks new segment |
| 7-8 | 10-20% improvement, addresses top-3 issue |
| 5-6 | 5-10% improvement, incremental |
| 3-4 | <5% improvement, unclear impact |
| 1-2 | No clear metric impact |

#### Complexity (10%, negative weight)

```
Complexity = (0.4 × TechnicalComplexity) + (0.4 × TimeEstimate) + (0.2 × RiskLevel)
```

| Technical | Scope |
|-----------|-------|
| 2-3 | Single system/surface |
| 4-6 | Multiple systems |
| 7-8 | Cross-platform + integrations |
| 9-10 | Major architectural change |

### Priority Tiers

| Score | Tier | Placement |
|-------|------|-----------|
| 8.0-10.0 | High Priority | Near-term roadmap |
| 5.0-7.9 | Medium Priority | Mid-term backlog |
| <5.0 | Low Priority | Long-term or deferred |

## Skill: Source Normalization

**Purpose**: Convert various input formats to citation-ready sources.

**When to Use**: Processing files, URLs, or text into research format.

### Input Handling

**URLs:**
- Fetch content
- Extract title, author, date
- Convert to markdown
- Add citation metadata

**Files (PDF, docs):**
- Extract text content
- Parse structure
- Create markdown representation
- Preserve source metadata

**Chat/Notes:**
- Capture insights from conversation
- Structure into source format
- Link to context

### Output Format

All sources normalized to:
- YAML frontmatter with metadata
- Key Insights section
- Strategic Applications section
- Citation-ready quotes
- Related internal links

## Context for Strategy Sessions

### Standard Context Assembly

For any strategy session, gather:

1. **Research Sources** from `datasets/research/sources/{topic}/`
2. **Related Meetings** from `datasets/meetings/Internal/Strategy/`
3. **Product Roadmap** context from `datasets/product/`

### Topic-Specific Context

| Topic | Additional Context |
|-------|-------------------|
| Pricing | Cost structure, customer WTP, competitive pricing |
| Product | Technical constraints, user research, feature usage |
| Competitive | Competitor analysis, market position, response history |
| Positioning | Customer segmentation, brand perception, messaging |

---

## Anti-Rationalization

| Rationalization | Reality |
|-----------------|---------|
| "Close enough" on quotes | Preserve exact wording |
| "Skip old meetings" | Process all in time window |
| "This signal doesn't fit" | Categorize best match or flag |
| "I remember an older version" | Use current data only |
