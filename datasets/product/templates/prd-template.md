## Metrics and Learning Agenda

> This section is used to list all of the metrics that will be used to measure the success of the implementation. Ensure to provide guidance if these metrics exist or need to be built. Make sure to incorporate guardrail metrics as well.

| Goals and Hypotheses | Signals | Metrics |
|----------------------|---------|---------|
| {What do you want to happen?} | {What would indicate success or validation?} | {What to measure to see these signals?} |
| | | |

## PRD Status Reference

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 🚧 Drafting | Known to be incomplete as it starts to come together. Do not rely on content at this point. |
| 🏃 Actionable | While it will continue to evolve with discovery through the process, Eng partners have agreed that there is enough to get going. |
| 🔒 Closed | The PRD represents what was finally delivered. Comments have been closed with outcomes incorporated in the document. |
| ❗ Abandoned | It shouldn't happen often, but when it does, flag a PRD this way so others will know the content may not represent a current state. |
