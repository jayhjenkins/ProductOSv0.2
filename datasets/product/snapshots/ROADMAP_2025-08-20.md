   - Objective: Capture agency market with aggressive Black Friday promotion featuring unlimited AI credits and $1,000/month pricing for 50 brands
   - Why now: Strategic decision to leverage Black Friday timing for agency acquisition; Hero Analytics competitive anchor at $500/month provides positioning advantage

2) **Launch Brand Black Friday Unlimited Promotion**
   - User story: As a DTC brand owner preparing for Black Friday, I want access to unlimited AI campaign optimization, email generation, and segmentation at dramatically reduced promotional pricing with clear tier selection, so I can iterate extensively on my highest-stakes campaigns without usage anxiety or budget constraints.
   - Objective: Enable brand market capture with unlimited AI access at 47-50% promotional discounts during Black Friday preparation period
   - Why now: Strategic decision to shift from margin optimization to aggressive market capture during Black Friday preparation period. 47-50% promotional discounts create overwhelming competitive advantage while maintaining 64-89% gross margins
   - Acceptance (summary): Pro Plan Tiers with segmentation at promotional pricing; Advanced Plan at $79/month; unlimited AI messages through Black Friday 2025; 12-month annual commitment

3) **Ingest Klaviyo Segment Performance Data for AI Recommendations**
   - User story: As a strategist, I want Raleon to recommend Klaviyo and Raleon segments that make sense for a given campaign based off of what's best for that campaign and what's worked historically for other campaigns like it.
   - Objective: Enable AI recommendations combining Klaviyo and Raleon segment performance data for enhanced campaign strategy
   - Why now: Shawn Killins (Info Killens Media/Milk Street) use case demonstrates need for segment performance analysis and AI recommendations that combine both Klaviyo and Raleon segment data
   - Acceptance (summary): Users can query best performing segments from both platforms; AI strategist recommends segments based on historical performance; segment performance metrics available for analysis

4) **Launch Agency Essentials Message-Based Credit Pricing Model v2.0**
   - User story: As an agency owner, I want to deploy Raleon across all my client brands with a clear, message-based credit system that I can easily understand and budget for, so I can scale my usage without worrying about abstract token calculations or surprise overages.
   - Objective: Enable agency rollout across unlimited brands with intuitive message-based credits and tiered bundles
   - Why now: Message-level usage analysis shows customer-friendly approach; 750 message base allocation with volume discounts addresses agency expansion barriers
   - Acceptance (summary): Message-based credit system (1 credit = 1 message); 750 base allocation; tiered bundles (50/$20, 100/$30, 200/$50); 70-85% gross margins

5) **Stabilize Email Generation System**
   - User story: As a customer using email generation, I want the system to consistently generate emails without crashes or failures, so I can rely on the feature for my campaign creation workflow.
   - Objective: Resolve critical email generation stability issues affecting text overlays, long text processing, and stylized templates
   - Why now: Reported by 8 customers across last 4 weeks; core product functionality undermining platform reliability
   - Acceptance (summary): Email generation success rate >95% for text overlays up to 20 words; long text processing completes without crashes in <30 seconds; stylized email generation works consistently

6) **Streamline Email Generation Onboarding Flow**
   - User story: As a new customer, I want to set up email generation quickly and easily without support intervention, so I can start creating campaigns within hours of signing up.
   - Objective: Reduce email generation setup time from 2 days to same-day activation through self-service onboarding
   - Why now: 3 new customers requested email generation beta access in past 4 days; Black Friday campaign season approaching requiring rapid activation
   - Acceptance (summary): Setup completion within 4 hours; >80% onboarding completion rate; 60% reduction in setup support tickets
