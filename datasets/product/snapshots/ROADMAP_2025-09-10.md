# Current Roadmap — 2025-09-10

## Plan (ranked)

1) **Launch Slack Integration Infrastructure and Weekly Automated Reports**
   - User story: As a brand manager or agency owner, I want Raleon to automatically send weekly reports and updates directly to my team's Slack channel, so my team stays informed about campaign performance without remembering to check the dashboard, and can easily click through to full chat experience for more detail.
   - Objective: Enable automated weekly reports delivered to existing workflow tools where teams collaborate
   - Why now: Customer feedback consistently shows teams want notifications delivered where they work; Slack is dominant business communication platform
   - Acceptance (summary): Slack OAuth integration functional; weekly job scheduling automated; formatted summaries with click-through URLs; test messaging with notifications

2) **Enhance Data Processing Status Visibility and Connection Clarity**
   - User story: As a user with data processing in progress, I want clear, prominent status indicators showing what's processing, completion percentage, and estimated time remaining, so I can plan my work and understand system availability.
   - Objective: Reduce support requests and improve user experience during data processing and integration setup
   - Why now: Identified as consistent support request pattern; processing status ambiguity creates perceived system unreliability; connection issues delay activation
   - Acceptance (summary): Prominent processing status dashboard; connection setup success rate >90%; "is my data done?" requests reduced by 70%

3) **Improve Segmentation Features and Adoption Through Enhanced Chat UX**
   - User story: As a user exploring segmentation features, I want clear explanations of segment status and smart recommendations for which segments to test first, so I can quickly understand the value and start using segments confidently.
   - Objective: Eliminate segment confusion and increase feature adoption through guided chat experience
   - Why now: CEO feedback identifies segmentation confusion as major barrier to "aha moments"; 0% trial segment usage; multiple customers struggle with adoption
   - Acceptance (summary): Users understand segment status >90% within first interaction; segment confusion tickets reduced 70%; trial usage increases 0% to >50%

4) **Improve UX for Getting Brand Images into Assets During Onboarding**
   - User story: As a new user setting up email generation, I want an intuitive and streamlined way to upload and organize my brand images, so I can quickly see high-quality AI-generated emails that represent my brand well.
   - Objective: Accelerate time to good email outputs and increase preference for AI over placeholders
   - Why now: CEO feedback identifies image onboarding as critical for "aha moments"; CustomEnvy shows preference for placeholders due to workflow complexity
   - Acceptance (summary): Image upload completes <5 minutes; first email generation satisfactory >70%; AI preference increases to >60%; setup tickets reduced 50%

5) **Feature Interest Routing in Onboarding Flow**
   - User story: As a new user completing onboarding, I want to indicate my primary interest (email generation, segmentation, campaign planning) and be immediately routed to that workflow, so I can start using the most relevant features right away.
   - Objective: Reduce time-to-value through personalized post-onboarding routing
   - Why now: CEO feedback identifies need to route people to right first onboarding flow; current generic approach delays value realization
   - Acceptance (summary): Feature interest capture >95% completion; post-onboarding routing successful; time-to-first-value reduced 40%; satisfaction increases

6) **Segmentation: Use profile-centric health monitoring**
   - User story: As a marketer using Raleon segments, I want profile-level health insights that tell me whether to send more emails to specific people regardless of which segments they're in, so I can make better targeting decisions across all my campaigns.
   - Objective: Shift from segment-focused to profile-focused health analysis for universal applicability
   - Why now: Strategic shift identified showing segment health rolls up from subscribers; profile-level works regardless of segment count
   - Acceptance (summary): Profile health computation every 5 days; consistent insights across segment memberships; actionable recommendations; clear demo value

7) **Launch Agency Essentials Message-Based Credit Pricing Model v2.0**
   - User story: As an agency owner, I want to deploy Raleon across all my client brands with a clear, message-based credit system that I can easily understand and budget for, so I can scale my usage without worrying about abstract token calculations or surprise overages.
   - Objective: Enable agency rollout across unlimited brands with intuitive message-based credits and tiered bundles
   - Why now: Message-level usage analysis shows customer-friendly approach; 750 message base allocation with volume discounts addresses agency expansion barriers
   - Acceptance (summary): Message-based credit system (1 credit = 1 message); 750 base allocation; tiered bundles (50/$20, 100/$30, 200/$50); 70-85% gross margins
