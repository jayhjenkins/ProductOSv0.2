   - Objective: Eliminate payment processing delays and retry scenarios that create conversion friction and unprofessional experience
   - Why now: Critical conversion blocker identified in strategy meetings (2025-08-26); affects all customer signups and professional perception

2) **Launch Brand Black Friday Unlimited Promotion**
   - User story: As a DTC brand owner preparing for Black Friday, I want access to unlimited AI campaign optimization, email generation, and segmentation at dramatically reduced promotional pricing with clear tier selection, so I can iterate extensively on my highest-stakes campaigns without usage anxiety or budget constraints.
   - Objective: Enable brand market capture with unlimited AI access at 47-50% promotional discounts during Black Friday preparation period
   - Why now: Strategic decision to shift from margin optimization to aggressive market capture during Black Friday preparation period. 47-50% promotional discounts create overwhelming competitive advantage while maintaining 64-89% gross margins
   - Acceptance (summary): Pro Plan Tiers with segmentation at promotional pricing; Advanced Plan at $79/month; unlimited AI messages through Black Friday 2025; 12-month annual commitment

3) **Enhance New Chat Experience and Feature Discovery**
   - User story: As a new user, I want to easily understand and access all Raleon capabilities through an intuitive interface, so I can maximize value from the platform without confusion.
   - Objective: Improve feature discovery and eliminate 24-second delay from "send email" to brief chat while enhancing overall user experience
   - Why now: Core UX problem identified in strategy discussions (2025-08-26); 50% of demo bookings are exploration-focused; affects user adoption and feature utilization

4) **Launch Agency Essentials Message-Based Credit Pricing Model v2.0**
   - User story: As an agency owner, I want to deploy Raleon across all my client brands with a clear, message-based credit system that I can easily understand and budget for, so I can scale my usage without worrying about abstract token calculations or surprise overages.
   - Objective: Enable agency rollout across unlimited brands with intuitive message-based credits and tiered bundles
   - Why now: Message-level usage analysis shows customer-friendly approach; 750 message base allocation with volume discounts addresses agency expansion barriers
   - Acceptance (summary): Message-based credit system (1 credit = 1 message); 750 base allocation; tiered bundles (50/$20, 100/$30, 200/$50); 70-85% gross margins

5) **Improve User Interface Mode Awareness and Switching**
   - User story: As a user switching between planning and email generation workflows, I want clear indication of current mode and seamless transitions with preserved context, so I can work efficiently without losing progress or getting confused.
   - Objective: Eliminate user confusion from mode changes and improve workflow continuity
   - Why now: Multiple customers reported confusion after recent UI update (2025-08-21); existing customers couldn't find planning artifacts; mode switcher tool exists but needs refinement
   - Acceptance (summary): Mode switching success rate >90%; user confusion reduced by 75%; context preservation during transitions; mode education overlay

6) **Enhance Data Processing Status Visibility and Connection Clarity**
   - User story: As a user with data processing in progress, I want clear, prominent status indicators showing what's processing, completion percentage, and estimated time remaining, so I can plan my work and understand system availability.
   - Objective: Reduce support requests and improve user experience during data processing and integration setup
   - Why now: Identified as consistent support request pattern; processing status ambiguity creates perceived system unreliability; connection issues delay activation
   - Acceptance (summary): Prominent processing status dashboard; connection setup success rate >90%; "is my data done?" requests reduced by 70%
