# Current Roadmap — 2025-08-28

## Plan (ranked)

1) **Enhance Chat Experience and Mode Switching**
   - User story: As a user of Raleon, I want to easily understand and access all platform capabilities through an intuitive interface with clear mode indication and seamless transitions, so I can maximize value from the platform without confusion or losing progress during workflow switches.
   - Objective: Improve feature discovery and eliminate mode confusion while enhancing overall user experience
   - Why now: Core UX problem affecting 50% of demo bookings; multiple customers reported mode confusion after recent UI update
   - Acceptance (summary): Mode selection <3 seconds; feature discovery increases usage by 40%; mode confusion reduced by 75%; discovery engagement >70%

2) **Enhance Data Processing Status Visibility and Connection Clarity**
   - User story: As a user with data processing in progress, I want clear, prominent status indicators showing what's processing, completion percentage, and estimated time remaining, so I can plan my work and understand system availability.
   - Objective: Reduce support requests and improve user experience during data processing and integration setup
   - Why now: Identified as consistent support request pattern; processing status ambiguity creates perceived system unreliability; connection issues delay activation
   - Acceptance (summary): Prominent processing status dashboard; connection setup success rate >90%; "is my data done?" requests reduced by 70%

3) **Launch Slack Integration Infrastructure and Weekly Automated Reports**
   - User story: As a brand manager or agency owner, I want Raleon to automatically send weekly reports and updates directly to my team's Slack channel, so my team stays informed about campaign performance without remembering to check the dashboard, and can easily click through to full chat experience for more detail.
   - Objective: Enable automated weekly reports delivered to existing workflow tools where teams collaborate
   - Why now: Customer feedback consistently shows teams want notifications delivered where they work; Slack is dominant business communication platform
   - Acceptance (summary): Slack OAuth integration functional; weekly job scheduling automated; formatted summaries with click-through URLs; test messaging with notifications

4) **Individual Save Controls for Knowledge Content Blocks**
   - User story: As a Raleon user updating content on the Knowledge page, I want save/cancel controls directly on each text block so I can save my changes immediately without scrolling, and I want clear warnings about unsaved changes so I never accidentally lose my work.
   - Objective: Eliminate customer data loss and improve Knowledge page UX
   - Why now: Active customer complaints about data loss; simple UX improvement with high impact on user satisfaction; prevents frustration and builds trust
   - Acceptance (summary): Save/cancel buttons on text blocks when editing; individual text block saves; unsaved changes detection; warning modal when leaving tab

5) **In-App Email Template Editor**
   - User story: As a brand using Raleon's email generation features, I want to edit email template text files directly within the Email Design tab so that I can customize my email prompts without breaking workflow to use external editors and file management.
   - Objective: Remove UX friction from email template customization workflow
   - Why now: Customers want to customize email templates but the current download/upload cycle creates friction that may reduce feature adoption and customization
   - Acceptance (summary): Direct text editing of templates within app; plain text editor with save/revert controls; add new template functionality; delete template functionality

6) **Launch Agency Essentials Message-Based Credit Pricing Model v2.0**
   - User story: As an agency owner, I want to deploy Raleon across all my client brands with a clear, message-based credit system that I can easily understand and budget for, so I can scale my usage without worrying about abstract token calculations or surprise overages.
   - Objective: Enable agency rollout across unlimited brands with intuitive message-based credits and tiered bundles
   - Why now: Message-level usage analysis shows customer-friendly approach; 750 message base allocation with volume discounts addresses agency expansion barriers
   - Acceptance (summary): Message-based credit system (1 credit = 1 message); 750 base allocation; tiered bundles (50/$20, 100/$30, 200/$50); 70-85% gross margins
