Market Research: DTC Lifecycle Marketing & Retention Roles

  

Key Buyer Personas in DTC Retention Marketing

  

1. Mid-Market Brand Retention Marketers (Lifecycle/CRM Managers): These are marketers at established DTC (direct-to-consumer) brands with annual online sales in the multi-million range (often $3–5M and above). Such companies often hire dedicated Lifecycle Marketing Managers, Retention Marketing Managers, or Email Marketing Managers to focus on customer retention and loyalty. There are thousands of people in these roles – for example, a job search shows over 9,500 openings for “Lifecycle Marketing Manager,” indicating high demand for this expertise . In the US, roughly 25,000 ecommerce companies generate over $1M in online sales , which is about 11% of the market. These mid-sized and larger DTC brands form a key persona: they have sufficient revenue and customer base to invest in advanced retention tools and staff. They typically use robust email platforms (Klaviyo, etc.) and are data-driven. Their motivations include improving customer lifetime value, increasing repeat purchase rates, and scaling personalized campaigns. They value tools that can connect to their data (shop and email systems), generate insights from performance history, and automate sophisticated tactics like segmentation. Importantly, they usually have budget for software – spending a few hundred dollars monthly on a high-value tool is justifiable if it boosts ROI. (Email marketing is known to return ~$42 per $1 spent on average , so these teams are willing to spend to gain an edge.)

  

2. Small DTC Brand Owners & Solo Marketers: This persona covers the solopreneurs, entrepreneurs, or small marketing teams running DTC brands with lower annual revenue (from pre-revenue up to a few hundred thousand or ~$1M). These are the countless small Shopify store owners and startup brands – indeed about 85% of e-commerce companies have under $1M in revenue . In the US there are close to 208,000 such small e-commerce companies , and globally the number is even higher. Often, the founder or a single employee handles email marketing alongside many other tasks. They do not have a dedicated “retention manager” title, but they effectively perform that function. Their pain point is lack of time and expertise – they must “do more with less,” running consistent email campaigns to drive sales without a large team or agency. They are attracted to tools that save time (automation and AI) and provide ready-made strategy and content ideas, since they may not be email experts themselves. However, their budgets are very limited: many of these small businesses spend under $100/month on email marketing total . (In a 2023 survey, 52% of businesses spending under $100 still saw strong email performance , showing that tiny budgets are common for small players.) This means a pricing entry point needs to be very affordable (or even free) to appeal to this segment. They are often using free or cheap plans of email tools – for example, Mailchimp’s free tier (up to 500 contacts) is popular among small business owners  . In short, small DTC marketers are motivated by anything that makes effective email marketing easier (content generation, campaign planning templates, etc.), but they have a low willingness to pay unless they clearly see value and can fit it into their micro-budgets.

  

3. Marketing Agencies and Consultants (Email Specialists): A significant portion of DTC brands outsource retention marketing to agencies or freelancers – in one survey 51% of companies said they use an agency/contractor for email marketing . This persona includes boutique email marketing agencies, freelance Klaviyo specialists, and consultants who manage email campaigns for multiple client brands. The ecosystem is large: Klaviyo’s partner network alone counts about 9,000 agency/partner providers globally . These professionals typically juggle several client accounts, each of which might be a small or mid-sized DTC brand. Their motivations are to deliver great results for clients efficiently. Time is money – if an AI-driven tool can help plan campaigns faster, generate on-brand copy, and analyze performance without manual effort, it directly increases an agency or freelancer’s productivity and margins. Many agencies already use Klaviyo (which has ~130k paying business customers ) and other ESPs; a complementary AI platform that integrates with these systems would be appealing. Agencies might be willing to invest in higher-tier plans if it means better service for clients – for instance, an agency managing 5–10 brands could justify a Pro or Enterprise plan (possibly leveraging an agency partner discount program) and roll that cost into client fees. However, independent freelancers who pay out-of-pocket are cost-sensitive; they often operate on tight budgets and will carefully consider tool ROI. For a solo consultant, $20/month vs. $100/month can be significant. (Many freelancers try to limit SaaS expenses – one report notes that while an upfront $3000 software purchase is impossible for a new freelancer, a $50/month subscription “might be doable” .) Thus, agencies and consultants represent a bifurcated persona: agencies with multiple client revenue streams can handle higher pricing (especially if tools help them win or retain clients), whereas solo freelancers lean toward lower-cost plans or free tools unless the value-add is clear and significant.

  

4. In-House Marketing Employees (Individual Users in Larger Firms): Another potential persona, related to the first, is the individual retention or email marketing manager inside a larger organization who might seek out a tool on their own. Sometimes, at mid-market or enterprise companies, the procurement process for new software is slow or budgets are locked, so an enterprising marketer might consider buying an affordable tool with personal or team discretionary funds. The Starter plan was originally theorized to target this case – an internal employee paying ~$20 out-of-pocket to get AI assistance for copy or strategy. The motivation here is personal performance: an email manager wants to hit their KPIs (better campaign results, more personalized content) and is willing to spend a small amount of their own money or minor team budget if it makes their job easier. However, this scenario will only occur if the cost is low (small enough to fly under the radar) and the benefit is tangible. Given that no customers have bought the $20 Starter plan to date, it suggests that either (a) these individuals don’t know about the product or don’t see enough value in that limited tier, or (b) they manage to get their company to approve the higher-tier because the features (integrations, data) are necessary. Still, this persona is worth noting as part of the addressable market: there are thousands of email/crm managers out there, but capturing them requires appealing to their need for quick wins (e.g. better copywriting, new ideas) without requiring corporate purchasing. The offering has to feel like a “personal productivity tool” rather than an enterprise platform, at least at the entry level.

  

Market Size and Segment Opportunities

  

The overall addressable market of DTC e-commerce retention marketers is substantial and growing. To size it in segments:

• Mid-market and Large DTC Brands: In the United States alone, roughly 25,000 e-commerce companies have >$1M in online sales , and about 10,000 of those are Shopify Plus stores (indicative of larger DTC brands) . Globally, including other regions, this number would be higher. Each of these companies likely employs at least one person focused on email/retention marketing (or they hire an agency). This gives on the order of tens of thousands of potential mid-market users (if not more when including global). The DTC model has boomed – there are ~110k–120k DTC companies in the US overall  (many are small, but the mid-tier is a sizable subset). This segment has budget and appetite for advanced tools; indeed, retention is critical as DTC brands scale (their investors and management emphasize LTV and repeat purchase). We see evidence of investment here: job postings for retention and lifecycle roles are abundant, and big brands like Nike derive a large share of profits from direct channels by leveraging customer data   – indicating a mature approach to retention marketing.

• Small and Emerging DTC Brands: This is the broad base of the pyramid. About 85% of e-commerce companies are very small (<$1M sales) , which translates to hundreds of thousands of businesses in North America, and easily over a million worldwide when including all Shopify, WooCommerce, Etsy sellers, etc. Not all of these are active or need advanced marketing tools, but the number of potential users in the “long tail” is huge. For example, one estimate put the count of DTC companies in the US at ~110k  – many of which would be owner-operated or have tiny teams. This group is hard to reach and monetize individually, but even a small fraction adopting an entry-level plan could mean significant volume. They often rely on entry-level email solutions (Mailchimp, etc.), which is why Mailchimp’s free plan attracted millions of users. (Mailchimp reported 14 million active users in 2020, mostly small businesses, and had ~67% market share of email platforms  before reducing its free tier.) That demonstrates the sheer volume of small businesses interested in email marketing help – the challenge is converting them when budgets are minimal. Offering a compelling free or low-cost product could tap into this vast pool, if done right.

• Agencies and Freelancers: The service-provider ecosystem is also large. Klaviyo’s IPO data shows 9,000+ agencies/partners in their network , and the lead Klaviyo educator (MagnetMonster) estimates possibly 5,000+ agencies/freelancers actively competing for DTC email marketing business  . Each agency might serve multiple brands – in theory, 5,000 agencies could cover 50,000 brands if evenly distributed . For our platform, agencies could either become multipliers (one agency account influences many client brands) or individual clients per brand. Many agencies will be looking for differentiation and efficiency – a platform that “automates your DTC retention marketing” (as Raleon positions itself) could be attractive, especially if there is an agency-friendly pricing model or the ability to manage multiple stores. Freelancers similarly number in the thousands (if not tens of thousands globally) – evidenced by the proliferation of specialists on LinkedIn, Upwork, etc., offering Klaviyo and email services . This segment might not purchase separate subscriptions for every small client (that would get expensive), but they might purchase one plan that helps them deliver work across clients. An agency-tier or ability to easily switch contexts would maximize appeal here. Agencies are currently a primary buyer for the Advanced and Pro tiers (as the user mentioned), so continuing to serve them at higher tiers makes sense, while perhaps a tailored “freelancer plan” at entry level could bring more of the solo consultants on board.

• Global Considerations: The focus is North America (where e-commerce and DTC adoption is high), but there’s also growth globally. For instance, Europe has many emerging DTC brands, and markets like India and Southeast Asia are seeing DTC startups as well. The personas remain similar globally, though willingness to pay may vary with purchasing power. (The platform could consider currency or regional pricing for broader reach, if relevant.)

  

In summary, the addressable market spans from perhaps ~20–30k core mid-market users (likely to buy high-tier plans) to hundreds of thousands of small-business users (only reachable via a low-cost or free model), plus thousands of agencies/freelancers who can influence adoption. This suggests a two-pronged strategy: a focused sales/marketing approach for mid-market brands (already working via Pro and Advanced tiers), and a volume-based, low-friction approach to capture the long tail (which the Starter or a freemium plan could target). The Starter tier’s potential user base (individual brand marketers, tiny DTC owners, freelancers) is large in number, but each contributes little revenue – hence the importance of figuring out the right feature set and price to both attract them and eventually convert a portion to higher plans.

  

Motivations and Pain Points of Retention Marketers

  

Despite their different contexts, these personas share some common drivers. Understanding these helps in aligning features and pricing with what they truly value:

• Saving Time and Increasing Efficiency: Virtually all retention marketers (from a solo founder to an agency team) are juggling many tasks. Email marketing is labor-intensive – brainstorming campaign ideas, writing copy, crafting segments, analyzing past results, etc. A top pain point observed is the challenge of producing effective content consistently: 42% of in-house marketing teams say creating effective email content is a major challenge . Likewise, agencies must produce quality campaigns at scale. Therefore, a tool that automates campaign planning, generates on-brand copy, or produces data-driven recommendations is solving a real pain (reducing hours spent on planning and writing). The ability to “chat with an AI strategist” and instantly get a campaign brief or content suggestions is highly motivating – it means even a one-person team can execute campaigns that normally might require a copywriter, analyst, and strategist. This promise of doing more with less is likely what attracted current Advanced/Pro users to Raleon. Ensuring the Starter tier also meaningfully saves time (even if with fewer features) will make it appealing. If Starter in its original form was too restricted (e.g. only very basic briefs), users might not have seen enough time-saving to justify even $20. We need to close that gap by delivering obvious efficiency wins at the entry level.

• Data-Driven Insights and Results: Retention marketers are ultimately judged by results – repeat sales, email revenue, open/click rates, etc. They have lots of data at their disposal (past campaigns, customer purchase behavior), but turning data into actionable strategy is challenging. In fact, marketers say that after gathering data, “figuring out how to best convert that data into profitability” is the new challenge . This is why integrations and analytics are valued: mid-market users want the AI to look at their historical campaign performance, product sales trends, customer segments, and then recommend the best plan (e.g. which products to promote to which segment this month). When the platform pulls in Klaviyo and Shopify data (as in the Advanced plan), it addresses this motivation by providing personalized, brand-specific guidance rather than generic advice. Smaller users also benefit from data insights, though if they have very little data (a brand-new store), the AI’s value might be more in general best practices until data accrues. Still, even a freelancer working with multiple small brands would love a tool that quickly analyzes whatever data is available (email open rates, etc.) to tell them what’s working and what to do next. Motivation: get better outcomes with less guesswork. If Raleon’s Starter plan lacked data integration, users may have felt the recommendations were too generic to improve their results. Including some level of data feedback loop (even in a limited way) could greatly increase the perceived value, because marketers are motivated by tools that drive higher ROI. (Over 74% of SMB email marketers say their efforts are at least moderately effective , but those struggling cite engagement as a top challenge  – a sign that smarter targeting/strategy is needed.)

• Improving Campaign Performance (KPIs): Retention roles are usually measured on metrics like customer retention rate, repeat purchase rate, email revenue, open/click rates, etc. They are highly motivated by anything that can improve these metrics. For example, if an AI tool can suggest subject lines or send times that lead to higher open rates, or identify a segment of dormant customers to re-engage (and provide a campaign idea for them), the marketer sees direct value. The UpCity survey found 43% struggle with maximizing click-through rates  and many focus on inspiring recipients to take action (though interestingly in that survey more prioritized list growth/new customers over retention content) . Nonetheless, roughly a quarter of marketers said customer retention is a primary goal of their email campaigns . So tools explicitly geared toward retention (like Raleon’s AI retention agent) speak to a well-known priority. Highlighting how each tier’s features map to better outcomes is key. For instance, segmentation (the Pro-tier feature) is a means to higher relevance and thus better KPIs. It’s worth noting a nuance: not all marketers can fully utilize advanced segmentation – an experienced email strategist on Reddit advised avoiding “over-segmentation” for smaller lists and focusing on a few key segments until scale warrants it . This aligns with Raleon’s tiering: smaller brands (Advanced tier) might stick to basic segmentation (or none beyond engagement level), whereas big brands (Pro tier) with 100k+ subscribers truly need sophisticated ML-based segments. Thus, keeping advanced segmentation in the Pro plan matches the motivation only of the larger, sophisticated users (and avoids overwhelming or cannibalizing smaller users who might not see value in it yet). The Starter persona likely cares more about improving content and getting campaign ideas than about granular segmentation.

• Budget and Cost Justification: While not a motivation per se, it’s a constant consideration – especially for the smaller personas. Marketers want tools that make their lives easier, but they often face tight budgets or need to prove ROI to justify spending. A starter/freemium offering lowers the barrier for these users to give the product a try. Many small businesses and freelancers are conditioned to seek free trials (or free tiers) and only pay once they’ve seen the value . In fact, a freelancer budgeting guide explicitly recommends: “Give the free version a shot first… in case it turns out to be all the power you need” . This suggests that our target individuals might expect a free taste. Mailchimp’s dominance was built on a generous free plan, and when Mailchimp started cutting back its free allowances, users flocked to other free alternatives  – underscoring how price-sensitive the mass of small users is. On the flip side, mid-market marketers are motivated by effectiveness even if it costs more. They know that if a tool can help drive even a few percent increase in email revenue, it pays for itself. UpCity’s data shows 37% of companies spend $101–$500/month on email marketing (tools/services) , and larger businesses often spend $500+ (where 51% saw ROI > $31 per $1) . So a $99–$199/month price for a product that demonstrably improves retention is acceptable for that tier. They key is to not erode the value perception at those higher tiers while adjusting the lower tier.

• Desire for Guidance and Skill Enhancement: Many individuals in retention roles (especially less experienced ones or those at smaller brands) are looking for guidance and learning. They may not have formal training in lifecycle marketing. An AI that not only executes tasks but also educates (e.g., suggests why a certain campaign is a good idea based on data, or provides benchmarks) can be very appealing. It’s like having a virtual mentor or strategist. This motivation means that even in a free or starter version, if the AI can teach the user something about their audience or give them new ideas, it builds loyalty. The user begins to rely on the tool not just for output but for improving their own strategy thinking. Catering to this by maybe unlocking certain insights or reports in higher tiers could be a way to entice upgrades (for instance, “Retention analytics” is a feature in Pro). But perhaps offering a taste of analytics insight at the entry level (without full integration) could hook users – e.g., maybe generic industry benchmarks or the ability to manually input a few metrics to get strategy tips.

• Agency/Freelancer Specific Needs: For agencies, a key motivation is scalability of service – being able to handle more clients or deliver better results without linear increase in labor. They also care about multi-client management (the friction if they had to log in/out for different stores, etc.). Agencies might also be motivated by white-labeling or collaboration – for instance, an agency might want to export the AI-generated strategy and share with their client under their own branding. While that’s more of a feature detail, it ties to motivation: agencies want tools that make them look good to their clients (faster turnaround, smarter recommendations). If the platform can position itself as “your AI retention team member” (which Raleon marketing actually suggests: a “team of tireless AI experts” ), an agency owner might see it as adding an AI employee who works 24/7. Pricing for agencies can often be higher because they pass through costs. However, agencies will compare the cost to hiring more staff – e.g., $199/mo vs the cost of a strategist’s hours. If the AI can replace even a few hours of a human’s work each week, it’s worth it. Freelancers similarly are motivated to maximize their billable output. A freelancer charging a client $1k for an email project might gladly pay $20–$50 for a tool that cuts their planning/writing time in half, since it boosts their effective hourly rate. But they need to be convinced it will do that (hence likely to try it free first, or month-to-month with low risk).

  

In summary, the core motivations are to get better results with less effort. Features that directly address those motivations (AI-driven planning = less effort brainstorming, integration = better results via data, copy generation = saves writing time, segmentation = better targeting for results, etc.) should be aligned to the tiers in a way that each persona feels the plan is “for them.” The Starter persona wants quick efficiency and guidance without a big price or setup. The Advanced persona (small/mid brand) wants deeper data integration to improve effectiveness, at a moderate cost. The Pro persona (mid-large brand or advanced agency) wants the full power including segmentation, and is willing to pay a premium for it.

  

Willingness to Pay and Pricing Insights

  

Pricing strategy should reflect both the value delivered and the ability/willingness to pay of each segment. Some relevant insights from the market:

• Small Businesses and Freelancers are Extremely Price-Sensitive: As noted, many small DTC operators keep marketing spend very low. In fact, the largest group of SMBs spends only $101–$500/month on email marketing in total (all tools and services) , and a significant subset (perhaps a third or more) spend <$100/month . For these users, an additional $99/month tool doubles or triples their spend – a hard sell unless it’s indispensable. The data suggests even spending $50/month can be a hurdle for a brand-new entrepreneur. A comment from a business advisor: “Not likely a new freelancer can drop $3000 on software, but $50 a month might be doable.” . That implies $50 is at the upper end of what a very small operator might personally pay for a tool subscription. Many will gravitate toward free solutions until their revenue grows. Freemium models are common in marketing tech for this reason. Mailchimp’s free plan (historically up to 2,000 contacts, now 500 contacts) became an industry standard; when Mailchimp tightened its free limits, users immediately started switching to other free services . This shows that if Raleon wants to capture the lower end, a free tier could be pivotal. Even if it’s heavily limited, free access removes the friction for someone to try it out and become convinced of the value. Once they use it in their workflow and outgrow the limits, they can upgrade. For instance, Slack and Canva used this approach in the B2B space – a truly useful free tier builds trust and drives adoption before converting users to paid plans . The downside of free is cost: the AI usage costs money to run (OpenAI or compute costs). So the free tier would need to be constrained enough (e.g., limited queries per month or no costly integrations) to avoid becoming a burden. We will discuss this in the Starter plan recommendations.

• Mid-Market and Larger Brands Have Budget (Within Reason): Companies doing millions in revenue generally allocate a percentage to marketing tools. A common guideline is that businesses might spend ~7-10% of revenue on marketing overall ; of that, tools/tech is a fraction, but retention is mission-critical. If an email manager at a $5M brand wants a $200/month tool that could increase retention revenue by even 5-10%, it’s a no-brainer ROI. The UpCity survey highlights that even businesses spending $500+ on email monthly see strong ROI (often $31+ per $1 spent) , and those spending at lower levels also see good ROI. Essentially, email marketing is so high-ROI (20x to 40x returns are common ) that investing in improving it is usually justifiable. This is reflected in Raleon’s current traction: the Advanced ($99) and Pro ($199) plans are selling and “working” according to the context. That indicates those price points align well with the willingness to pay of small-mid and mid-large brand customers (and the agencies serving them). We likely should preserve those price points or close to them, and instead tweak what the Starter is and costs.

• Agencies’ Willingness to Pay: Agencies typically pass software costs onto clients or consider it part of their operating expenses. If an agency can use one Pro plan at $199 to service multiple clients, that’s very affordable per client. In fact, many agencies charge clients $2k–$3k per month for fully managed retention services . A $199 software that maybe replaces some manual labor is trivial in that context. So agencies are likely willing to pay for higher tiers (or multiple licenses) as long as the tool demonstrably saves time or improves results. If anything, agencies might be more concerned about how to manage multiple brands with the tool (possibly needing an Enterprise or agency multi-account feature). The pricing page shows an Enterprise tier at $399 with custom features and an agency program link , implying there are special arrangements for agencies (possibly volume discounts or the ability to manage several stores). For the Starter concept, freelancers (one-person “agencies”) are more relevant – they align with that low-cost need. Many freelancers might not pay $99 per client, but they might pay, say, $49 and use it across a couple of small clients (even if not fully intended by terms). This suggests that a “freelancer plan” at $49 could capture value that $20 did not. At $20, maybe freelancers assumed it was too basic; at $49 (with more features), they might see it as a professional tool still within a personal budget. It’s telling that zero customers took the $20 Starter – possibly it was perceived as too limited for a pro user, yet still not free for a hobbyist, landing in a no-man’s-land. Adjusting price upwards with more value could actually attract serious users who dismissed the $20 tier as not useful enough.

• Exploring a Free vs. Paid Entry Strategy: The company is open to even a free offering (“as low as free, if it makes sense” was mentioned). The decision between a lower price vs. freemium is crucial. Research and precedent suggest:

• A Free Tier can massively increase top-of-funnel signups, especially in a crowded market where 46% of marketers struggle to even choose the right tool . Being able to try without a credit card could differentiate Raleon and build word-of-mouth among the small business community. However, free users need to be nurtured into paying customers at some point (either by hitting limits or realizing the extra features are worth it). One risk: free users might stay perpetually free if the free tier is “too good.” So the free version must be useful but clearly limited, aligning with the idea that it’s for evaluation and basic use only. For example, Mailchimp’s free tier puts caps on contacts and sends (forcing growing businesses to upgrade) . In Raleon’s context, a free plan might cap the number of AI queries per month (or even per day), or limit the depth of analysis (no integrations, just generic strategy Q&A). This would let an entrepreneur see the AI’s capabilities on a surface level. We know from UpCity that 39% of teams doing email in-house struggle with finding the right tools  – a free tier gets Raleon in the door as the “right tool” before they even allocate budget. Additionally, offering a free plan can be a marketing strategy in itself: it increases brand exposure and user base, which can later be upsold. Many SaaS companies use free as an acquisition strategy, especially if variable costs can be controlled (e.g., limit AI calls, which control API costs).

• A Cheap Paid Tier ($10–$50 range) ensures users have some skin in the game and filters for those who are serious. It can also avoid a flood of completely non-qualified free users who might abuse the system. If the company wants to avoid pure free due to cost concerns, a middle ground could be a “quasi-free” pricing – for example, $9 or $19 per month, essentially a nominal fee that still signals “entry-level.” However, since $20 Starter already saw no takers, simply lowering price further might not change the outcome unless the feature set changes. It might be that value, not price, is the issue – i.e., people didn’t buy $20 Starter because it didn’t do enough for them, not purely because $20 was too high. In fact, $20 is quite low for a business tool; the lack of sales suggests the included features were insufficient to even warrant $20. This points to the need to add more value to Starter (or any entry tier), whether it stays paid or becomes free. One idea the team floated is making it more expensive but with more features – e.g. $49 with Klaviyo integration. This could reposition Starter as a truly useful “lite” version of Advanced, rather than an almost-toy version. At $49, it targets serious solo marketers and freelancers (who likely find $49 still affordable in a business context).

• Psychological Pricing & Tier Differentiation: Currently, the tiers are $20 – $99 – $199 (and Enterprise $399). That’s a common tier spacing (each roughly 2x–5x the previous). If Starter were free or say $9, the gap to $99 Advanced might feel huge, which could either discourage upgrading (too big a jump) or make advanced look “premium” (which might be fine). If Starter becomes $49, the gaps become $49 – $99 – $199, which is more even. That could make upgrade decisions more incremental. On the other hand, introducing a free tier below $20 might allow an interim paid tier at, say, $49 anyway. It’s worth considering if four tiers (Free, Starter, Advanced, Pro) make sense, or just three tiers with a redefined entry. Some SaaS opt for Free, Mid, High, Enterprise. Given Raleon already has Enterprise as a custom high end, adding a Free below would make it Free – $99 – $199 – $399. That leaves a big gap between free and $99. Perhaps that is where a $49 “Starter” could live, making it actually a four-tier structure (Free, Starter $49, Advanced $99, Pro $199, with Enterprise above). This could capture different segments: free for hobbyists and explorers, $49 for freelancers/tiny brands that need a bit of integration, $99 for growing brands, $199 for serious brands, $399 for large/agency unlimited. This multi-tier approach is complex but could maximize coverage. The risk is complexity in messaging – too many tiers can confuse customers. However, many SaaS handle this by clearly stating who each plan is for (e.g., “Freelancer,” “Growing Business,” “Pro Marketer,” etc.).

• Value-Based Feature Gating: Willingness to pay is directly tied to which features a persona can’t live without. For entry-level users, the feedback is that completely excluding integrations and email generation made the Starter plan unattractive. Those features were evidently seen as core to the product’s value. If someone trialed Raleon, they likely experienced the full feature set (since a free trial was offered). After trial, dropping to Starter meant losing integrations (no Klaviyo/Shopify data) and losing the email generation capability according to the original plan design. That’s a double whammy: the AI could no longer personalize recommendations with actual data, and it wouldn’t even output full emails, just briefs. For many users, that would feel like the tool became a lot less useful – hence none chose to pay for that. Most opted for Advanced or nothing. This indicates that at least one of those valuable features must be available at entry level to make it worth paying at all. Possibly the user feedback is that email copy generation is a must-have for any plan. The pricing page currently shows Starter does include “Branded copywriting” and “Email generation”  (perhaps they updated it), but the problem might have been the lack of data integration to make that copy intelligent. Therefore, adding some form of integration to the entry tier could be key. The idea of including Klaviyo integration but not Shopify in a revised Starter ($49) is one way to do it. That would allow the AI to see email engagement data (open rates, click rates by campaign, etc.) which is very useful for improving strategy and content, but it wouldn’t pull product catalogs or sales numbers from Shopify. The rationale: a freelancer or small brand could connect Klaviyo (which most have if they’re doing any serious email; if they only have Mailchimp, that’s another consideration – maybe a Mailchimp integration too, but Klaviyo is prevalent in DTC). With Klaviyo data, the AI can analyze which past emails performed well and guide the next campaign. This addresses their motivation for data-driven insights at a basic level. It still withholds full multi-integration and the advanced “AI analysis” features for the $99 tier, preserving value there. Another approach could be to allow a Shopify integration instead of Klaviyo – if the goal is to let the AI know the product catalog and maybe pull basic sales trends. But likely Klaviyo yields more directly actionable insight for email strategy, so it’s the better candidate for inclusion.

• Free Trial vs. Free Tier: It’s noted the product currently offers a 14-day free trial for any plan . Free trial is great for converting those already interested, but it doesn’t capture people who are just casually exploring or not ready to evaluate fully in a short window. A free tier is different: it lets users tinker at their own pace, possibly for months, before committing. This can dramatically widen the funnel, but it also means nurturing a lot of free users. If going freemium, one must monitor conversion rates to paid and ensure the free tier isn’t cannibalizing paid unnecessarily. One tactic if freemium is introduced: restrict certain high-value outputs to paid plans. For example, maybe the AI can produce a brief summary or outline on free, but full campaign content generation is a paid feature. Or limit how many campaigns per month the free tier can plan. Those kinds of throttles create a natural moment where a power user says “I love this, I need more, I’ll pay.” UpCity’s finding that finding the right tool is the #1 challenge for 46% of marketers  suggests once they find a tool that clearly helps, they’ll be relieved and more willing to invest. The key is getting them to find/experience it – which a free tier can facilitate.

  

In essence, willingness to pay correlates strongly with company size and perceived feature value:

• Enterprise and mid-market: willing to pay $100s to even $1000s if justified – keep them on robust $199/$399 plans with full capabilities.

• Established small brands (the 6-7 figure revenue range) and agencies: $99 seems acceptable (current adoption confirms this), but some of these might also be okay with ~$49 if they don’t need everything.

• Very small brands/freelancers: likely unwilling to pay $99; $20 was not enticing due to low value; something around $0–$50 with meaningful utility is needed to capture them.

• Individuals paying personally: the threshold is low – $10 or $20 might have been fine if it truly made their job easier. But again, $20 with not enough functionality didn’t sell. Interestingly, charging more (say $49) but providing more might actually convert better because serious users see it as a “real tool” worth investing in, whereas $20 felt like it might be too entry-level. We should not assume lower price always = more sales; it’s about value alignment.

  

Recommendations for the Starter Plan Strategy

  

Given the research findings, here are evidence-based recommendations on how to re-position the Starter tier (or a new entry-level offering) to successfully target the missing personas (freelancers, individual internal marketers, and very small DTC brands) without cannibalizing the higher plans:

• 1. Introduce a Freemium Entry Tier (Highly Limited Free Plan): To capture the huge base of small potential users, a free plan could be a game-changer. This plan would include the basic AI Strategist chat and perhaps a few “teaser” features, but with tight limits:

• For example, allow perhaps 5–10 AI queries per month on the free plan (or a small number per day) – enough for users to get a taste of generating a campaign idea or asking a strategy question, but not enough to run an entire robust email program without hitting a wall.

• No integrations on free (the AI would only have whatever info the user manually provides about their brand). This protects the value of paid plans because the AI cannot pull real performance data or customer data on the free tier.

• Possibly exclude full email generation on free – maybe the free tier can output a brief or subject line ideas, but not the complete email copy design. Or it outputs a watermarked version. This way, users see the potential but know they need to upgrade for the heavy lifting.

• Provide basic support only (community or self-serve resources) for free users, reserving live chat support for paid users to manage support costs.

The goal is to let anyone (an employee experimenting on a side project, a student, a tiny startup) sign up and experience the core value: an AI that understands DTC marketing and provides ideas/strategy. This builds goodwill and awareness. Over time, some free users will convert to paid as their needs grow. Others might churn out, but they wouldn’t have paid anyway, so the cost is just the compute time. We have to ensure that cost is controlled via the usage limits.

• Importantly, the free plan should be positioned as “Raleon Trial/Freemium – For hobbyists or testing the waters.” It can coexist with the 14-day free trial of higher tiers (perhaps the trial gives them a temporary taste of advanced features, and if they don’t buy, they downgrade to the perpetually free basic tier instead of leaving entirely). Many SaaS do this: after a trial, if user doesn’t convert, they offer to continue on a limited free plan. This way, we don’t lose the user entirely – we keep nurturing them via email marketing (ironically, using our own platform’s principles) until they hopefully decide to upgrade.

Why freemium: As discussed, the addressable market at the low end is huge (hundreds of thousands of small businesses). Even if conversion to paid is, say, 5-10%, that could funnel a large number into Starter/Advanced over time. Freemium also leverages network effects: small brand owners often share tips in communities; having a free option means Raleon can be recommended without reservation (“you should try this tool, there’s a free version”). This increases our reach significantly, something a $20 paid gate did not achieve. The risk (cannibalization of Starter sales) seems low because currently Starter isn’t selling at all; a free plan would actually warm users up who might later jump directly to Advanced.

• 2. Re-package “Starter” as an Upsell from Free with More Value (Potentially at ~$49/month): Whether or not a free tier is introduced, the entry paid tier needs a value boost. I recommend considering a Starter (or call it “Standard” or “Essentials”) plan around $49/month that includes a subset of the advanced features:

• Include 1 Integration (Klaviyo): Unlock the Klaviyo data integration at this tier. This gives users the feedback loop of their email performance data, which dramatically improves the AI’s utility. They’ll get campaign-specific insights (e.g., “last week’s email had 20% open rate, which is above your average; let’s try a similar subject approach this week”). Importantly, still exclude Shopify integration at this level – that data (product sales, etc.) can be reserved for Advanced ($99) and up. By doing this, a $49 user can see how their emails perform and get AI suggestions based on engagement metrics, but they won’t get full revenue analytics or product recommendations from inventory. That latter piece is more critical for larger brands planning cross-channel or needing product-specific strategy, which they’d pay $99+ for.

• Allow Email Content Generation: Ensure that even at $49, the user can generate actual email copy and designs (perhaps via the integration to their email platform or as HTML output). This is a key feature that people expect from an “AI email tool.” If previously Starter lacked this, adding it will make the plan immediately more attractive. This doesn’t step on Pro’s toes because Pro’s differentiator is segmentation and more AI capacity.

• Limit Usage Compared to Advanced: Maybe this tier can have something like “Up to 20 messages per day” (as originally for Starter) while Advanced gets 30, Pro 50  . Also limit the number of analytics queries or reports the AI can run. Advanced might do deep data analysis on demand, whereas Starter $49 could maybe allow only predefined basic analysis. This way, heavy users or those wanting more freedom will see reason to go to $99.

• No “Brainstorm mode” or Advanced learning: The pricing page mentions “Advanced agent learning” and “Agent brainstorm mode” in the Advanced tier  . Those can remain exclusive to Advanced. Starter users might not even notice what they are missing, but power users will be enticed to upgrade for those fancy capabilities once they grasp the basics.

• Positioning: Market this tier as “For freelancers and small brands starting out – get the core AI features and Klaviyo insights to boost your email marketing”. By explicitly targeting it, you won’t cannibalize Advanced’s perceived value for serious brands. Advanced can be positioned as “for growing brands that also want Shopify data and deeper AI analysis,” and Pro “for scale-ups needing segmentation and full power.”

The rationale behind possibly raising Starter price to $49 (from $20) is that users are willing to pay if the feature-set solves their needs. The current $20 plan did not sell because it was too stripped down. Charging $49 but giving a useful integration and content generation could actually be seen as a bargain to a busy marketer or freelancer. We saw evidence that freelancers consider $50/month doable for a valuable tool . Furthermore, $49 is still half the cost of Advanced, so there’s clear differentiation: an entrepreneur might start at $49, and when their store crosses, say, $250k in sales or they want more automation, they can jump to $99. We maintain the principle of not undercutting the $99 tier’s value because certain capabilities (Shopify integration, advanced AI modes, etc.) remain only at $99. In effect, $49 Starter would serve those who currently churn after trial or never convert because $99 was too high a step initially. It could also capture those who might have considered $20 but didn’t see value – now they see it’s more robust (for a higher price, but justifiable). We should monitor how many Advanced users might downgrade to $49 if such a plan exists – ideally, the feature gating is enough that established $99 users wouldn’t want to lose their second integration or advanced features. (We can mitigate downgrades by, for instance, making the Shopify integration the one they’d lose – any brand actually using that for product analytics likely won’t give it up just to save $50.)

• 3. Consider a Usage-Limited Free Plan as an Alternative to a Cheaper Paid Plan (Option Analysis): If offering free is a concern, another idea is a “Starter Lite” at a very low price (like $9 or $15) which basically serves the role of freemium by being almost no barrier. However, given standard SaaS practices and user psychology, a well-designed free tier often yields better pipeline than a token $9 fee (which can still deter many from ever trying it). Many successful SaaS in the marketing domain (e.g., Mailchimp, HubSpot CRM, Canva) chose true free rather than ultra-cheap, because free vastly increases adoption and word-of-mouth  . Thus, I lean towards recommending an actual free tier as above. It’s also worth noting that Raleon’s competition might not be direct apples-to-apples, but if other AI marketing tools start to offer free trials or free features, we wouldn’t want to be the only one without a free option. Early adoption of a freemium model could outpace competitors and become a moat (with lots of users and data network effects).

• 4. Protect the Value of Advanced and Pro Plans: While tweaking Starter, we must ensure Advanced ($99) and Pro ($199) remain compelling for their intended users. The research confirms those tiers match the needs of their buyers:

• Advanced includes 2 integrations (most likely Shopify + Klaviyo for a holistic view), automated AI data analysis, and more AI capacity  . These are exactly what a small-mid DTC brand (with a bit more sophistication) or an agency working on a store would want once they’re serious. We should keep these differentiators. If we give Klaviyo integration to Starter, we must keep Shopify integration as Advanced-only as mentioned. Also, perhaps limit Starter’s Klaviyo integration to fewer data points (maybe it pulls campaign metrics but not customer-level data, if that’s technically possible) – whereas Advanced could do deeper cohort analysis because it can cross-reference sales from Shopify. As long as Advanced clearly “includes everything in Starter, plus…” more valuable capabilities, users will upgrade as their needs grow. We should explicitly avoid offering segmentation (ML-driven) or unlimited integrations at anything below Pro – those remain the crown jewels for Pro to justify $199. The Pro plan’s audience (mid-market brands, larger agencies) has shown willingness to pay and is not very price-sensitive as long as the feature is unique (AI segmentation is a distinctive feature). The current pricing of Pro at $199 is quite reasonable given those brands likely pay thousands for ESP and CRM tools. So Pro can remain intact; we just ensure our changes to lower tiers don’t hand any Pro-exclusive features downward. (They won’t – segmentation, Slack support, custom AI signals, etc., will stay Pro/Enterprise  .)

• One area to be cautious: If we allow too many messages or too much usage on a cheaper plan, some mid-sized customers might try to save money by using multiple cheap accounts or similar. To prevent that, usage limits and possibly watermarking outputs or not allowing multiple brand profiles on Starter could help. For example, Starter could be restricted to one brand profile (one set of brand guidelines) at a time, whereas Advanced might handle multiple brand stores (if an agency tries to cheat by using one Starter for two clients, it would be cumbersome if they have to keep swapping brand info). The agency program can explicitly offer discounts on multiple Advanced/Pro seats to deter that kind of downgrading hack.

• 5. Emphasize the Upgrade Path in UX and Marketing: Whatever changes are made, it will be important to clearly communicate who each plan is for and gently push users up when they hit the limits. For instance, if a user on the free plan tries to do something that’s an Advanced feature (say, connect a Shopify store or create a custom segment), the app should prompt: “That’s available on our Advanced Plan – upgrade to unlock this feature.” The research shows users will pay when they perceive clear value and necessity. Many small businesses don’t realize what they’re missing until they see it. So if our Starter user, for example, sees a dashboard tile saying “Your retention analytics and product insights are locked – available in Advanced”, that might entice them when they’re ready for more growth. Similarly, a $49 Starter user might see “Add your Shopify integration by upgrading to Advanced” or “Unlock double the AI queries and brainstorm mode in Advanced.” This way, we treat Starter not as the end, but as a stepping stone (bottom-up strategy). This aligns with the company’s desire for a good bottoms-up approach for individuals that feeds into a sales-led approach for mid-market. Essentially, free/Starter gets people in, some graduate to Advanced on their own as their business grows, and the biggest successes eventually get sales outreach for Enterprise deals, etc. This mirrors the classic SaaS funnel.

• 6. Explore a “Starter for Teams” Scenario Carefully: One interesting original hypothesis was internal employees paying out-of-pocket. If we still think that’s a viable segment, perhaps the free tier or $49 tier could be marketed as “Personal Edition for Marketers” – something an individual can sign up for independently of their company. If that gains traction (people at larger firms using it in rogue fashion), it could actually lead to a land-and-expand: the individual proves its value and then advocates for the company to buy higher tiers for the whole team. We saw this dynamic with tools like Slack, where employees used the free version until the company officially adopted it. Given 46% of marketers find choosing email tools challenging , if one team member solves part of that with an AI assistant, others will notice. So enabling easy individual signup (through free or low-cost starter) could indirectly penetrate bigger organizations as well. We should ensure the sign-up process and terms permit an individual to use it with their company’s data in a compliant way (no big obstacles to connecting, say, a company’s Klaviyo account to a personal-paid Raleon account, if that’s how they do it). If lots of those pop up, it’s a signal for sales to approach the company about an enterprise license with admin controls, etc.

• 7. Monitor and Iterate: This market research provides direction, but it will be crucial to monitor the outcomes of any pricing change. Metrics to watch include:

• Conversion rate from free -> paid (if freemium launched). Industry benchmarks vary, but even a 5% conversion could be solid given a large base. If conversion is too low, maybe the free tier is too generous or the value of paid not clear.

• Adoption rate of the new Starter ($49) vs previous. Ideally, we go from 0 customers at $20 to many at $49 because of added value. If still low, then either price is still an issue or awareness is.

• Any churn or downgrade from Advanced to Starter. If that happens frequently, we may have given too much in Starter. We might then adjust by nudging some features back up.

• Feedback from users: do freelancers find the new plan attractive? Are small merchants saying “this is exactly what we needed”?

Given the dynamic nature of SaaS, we should be ready to adjust pricing or packaging again based on real data, but the research suggests the above approach aligns more closely with market expectations.

  

In conclusion, the research points to a substantial opportunity to capture individuals (freelancers, solo entrepreneurs, and curious marketing employees) by lowering the barrier to experiencing Raleon’s AI. By offering either a free tier or a more feature-rich affordable tier, we can align with what motivates these users: quick wins in their email marketing tasks without significant cost. At the same time, we preserve the integrity and value of the Advanced and Pro tiers for the core revenue-generating customers (mid-market brands and agencies) by keeping the most advanced capabilities exclusive. This tiered strategy – essentially segmenting the market by size/needs – should allow Raleon to expand its user base at the low end (for long-term upsell pipeline) and continue maximizing value at the high end (for short-term revenue).

  

Finally, all of this should be messaged clearly. Perhaps rebrand the Starter tier with a name that speaks to the target (e.g., “Raleon Lite” or “Freelancer Plan”) to avoid confusion with “Starter = not useful.” Emphasize in marketing that “Lite” is great for getting started or working on a single small brand, while “Pro” is for those managing complex retention programs. If done right, this will solve the original problem: finding a better entry point that drives distribution and adoption, seeding more users into the ecosystem who can later become loyal, paying customers at higher tiers.
