# ICE Scoring Framework: Segmentation Roadmap Prioritization

**Decision Framework**: ICE Scoring (Impact, Confidence, Ease)
**Application**: Product roadmap prioritization for 7 segmentation problem cases
**Strategic Context**: Agency-first customer focus with enterprise/SMB considerations

## Framework Overview

ICE scoring evaluates each initiative across three dimensions on a 1-10 scale:

- **Impact (I)**: Potential business impact if successful
- **Confidence (C)**: Confidence in our ability to execute successfully  
- **Ease (E)**: Implementation difficulty (10 = very easy, 1 = very difficult)

**Final Score**: (Impact × Confidence × Ease) / 100

## Scoring Criteria

### Impact Scoring (1-10)

**Agency Impact (Primary Weight: 60%)**
- 10: Transforms agency efficiency/revenue potential significantly
- 8-9: Major improvement to agency workflows or client results

### Confidence Scoring (1-10)

**Technical Confidence (50%)**
- 10: Clear implementation path with proven technology
- 8-9: Straightforward development with minor unknowns
- 6-7: Moderate complexity with manageable risks
- 4-5: Significant technical challenges but solvable
- 1-3: High technical risk or unproven approach

**Customer Evidence Confidence (30%)**
- 10: Multiple customers explicitly requesting solution
- 8-9: Strong evidence from customer calls/behavior
- 6-7: Good indicators of customer need
- 4-5: Some supporting evidence but unclear demand
- 1-3: Assumption-based or conflicting evidence

**Team Execution Confidence (20%)**
- 10: Perfect fit for current team skills and capacity
- 8-9: Good match with minor skill gaps
- 6-7: Reasonable execution capability
- 4-5: Requires significant learning or external help
- 1-3: Outside current team competencies

**Confidence Modifiers**:
- +2: August 28th strategy meeting validated technical approach
- +1: Existing codebase/data supports implementation
- +1: Clear customer validation from multiple sources
- -1: Requires new integrations or external dependencies
- -2: Assumption-heavy with limited validation

### Ease Scoring (1-10)

**Development Complexity (40%)**
- 10: Simple feature addition to existing systems
- 8-9: Moderate development effort, clear scope
- 6-7: Substantial development but manageable
- 4-5: Complex implementation requiring multiple components
- 1-3: Major system changes or architectural work

**Integration Complexity (30%)**
- 10: No external dependencies or integrations required
- 8-9: Simple integration with existing tools
- 6-7: Moderate integration complexity
- 4-5: Multiple integration points or API dependencies
- 1-3: Complex third-party integrations or data migrations

**Timeline to Value (30%)**
- 10: Immediate customer value upon release
- 8-9: Quick customer adoption expected
- 6-7: Moderate onboarding/adoption curve
- 4-5: Requires customer education or behavior change
- 1-3: Long adoption cycle or significant customer effort

**Ease Modifiers**:
- +2: Leverages existing Klaviyo/Shopify data and integrations
- +1: Jason freed up to focus on segmentation features
- +1: Can build on existing segment infrastructure
- -1: Requires new UI/UX patterns
- -2: Needs real-time processing or complex ML models

## Agency-Centric Evaluation Lens

Given our strategic focus on agencies as the primary customer segment, each problem case will be evaluated through these agency-specific lenses:

### Agency Value Drivers
1. **Revenue per client**: Does this help agencies generate more revenue from each client relationship?
2. **Operational efficiency**: Does this reduce manual work or increase output capacity?
3. **Client retention**: Does this improve the agencies' client results and retention?
4. **Competitive differentiation**: Does this provide unique value agencies can't get elsewhere?
5. **Scalability**: Does this help agencies take on more clients without proportional cost increases?

### Agency Implementation Considerations
1. **Onboarding complexity**: How easy is it for agencies to adopt and train their teams?
2. **Client communication**: How easy is it for agencies to explain value to their clients?
3. **Integration workflow**: How well does this fit into existing agency processes?
4. **Pricing model fit**: How does this align with our agency credit/usage-based pricing?

## Scoring Matrix Template

For each of the 7 segmentation problem cases, we'll evaluate:

| Problem Case | Impact | Confidence | Ease | ICE Score | Priority Rank |
|-------------|--------|------------|------|-----------|---------------|
| 1. Performance Pattern Recognition | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| 2. Frequency Management | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| 3. Real-time Data | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| 4. Segment Adoption Friction | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| 5. Complexity Overwhelm | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| 6. Content-Segment Matching | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| 7. Customer Lead Scoring | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |

## Implementation Sequencing Considerations

Beyond raw ICE scores, we'll consider:

1. **Prerequisites**: Does one problem case enable others?
2. **Customer momentum**: Which creates early wins to build confidence?
3. **Resource allocation**: How do we balance quick wins vs. strategic investments?
4. **Feedback loops**: Which provides the best learning for subsequent development?

## Risk Assessment Framework

For each highly-scored initiative, we'll evaluate:

- **Technical risks**: What could go wrong in development?
- **Market risks**: What if customer demand is lower than expected?
- **Competitive risks**: Could competitors replicate quickly?
- **Resource risks**: Do we have sustained capacity for implementation?

This framework will guide our systematic evaluation of each segmentation problem case to determine optimal prioritization for product development.
