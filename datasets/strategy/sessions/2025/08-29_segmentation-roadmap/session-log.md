# Strategy Session Log: Segmentation Roadmap Prioritization

**Date**: 2025-08-29
**Framework**: ICE Scoring (Impact, Confidence, Ease)
**Participants**: Jay Jenkins (initial session setup)
**Strategic Question**: How should we prioritize the 7 segmentation problem cases for product development, considering our focus on agencies as the most important customer segment?

---

## Session Initialization

### Decision Context
We have identified 7 distinct segmentation problem cases through extensive customer research and the August 28th strategy meeting with Nathan about Segmentation AI 3.0. Each addresses different customer needs across agencies, enterprise brands, and SMB segments with varying levels of supporting evidence.

### Key Constraints
- 5-person development team with limited capacity
- Strategic focus on agencies as primary customer segment
- Current ARR of $152k with growth trajectory needs
- 2-week investor outreach timeline creates urgency
- Jason freed up to focus on segmentation features

### Success Criteria
- Clear prioritization of 7 problem cases using ICE scoring
- Agency-centric evaluation ensuring strategic alignment
- Implementation roadmap considering team capacity and technical feasibility
- Customer validation alignment with business objectives

## ICE Scoring Analysis

### Session Plan
1. **Systematic Evaluation**: Score each of 7 problem cases across Impact, Confidence, Ease
2. **Agency Lens Application**: Apply 60% weighting to agency impact considerations
3. **Evidence Validation**: Ensure scoring aligns with customer meeting evidence
4. **Strategic Alignment**: Verify recommendations support agency-first strategy
5. **Implementation Sequencing**: Consider prerequisites and resource allocation

### Ready for Interactive Analysis

The session is now set up for systematic evaluation of each segmentation problem case. The next step is to begin scoring each initiative using the ICE framework with particular attention to:

- **Agency value drivers** (revenue per client, operational efficiency, client retention)
- **Customer evidence strength** from meetings with Killens, Homestead, Soapbox, RadRoller, Better Brand, Owlette
- **Technical feasibility** based on August 28th strategy discussion about implementation approaches
- **Resource requirements** considering current team capacity and priorities

## Next Steps for Interactive Decision-Making

1. **Begin ICE Scoring**: Systematically evaluate each problem case
2. **Validate Against Evidence**: Cross-reference scores with customer meeting data
3. **Consider Implementation Sequencing**: Identify dependencies and optimal rollout order
4. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate potential downsides and mitigation strategies
5. **Final Recommendation**: Provide clear prioritization with rationale
