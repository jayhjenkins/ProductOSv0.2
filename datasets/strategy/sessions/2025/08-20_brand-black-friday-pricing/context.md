# Strategy Session Context: Brand Black Friday Unlimited Plan

**Session Date**: 2025-08-20  
**Decision Question**: How should we structure a Black Friday unlimited plan for individual brands that mirrors the successful agency promotion while maintaining sustainable unit economics?

## Research Context Assembled

### Primary Sources: Agency Pricing Models & Unit Economics

#### 1. Agency Black Friday Promotion (Live Model)
**Source**: `/datasets/product/epics/2025/EPIC_launch-agency-black-friday-promotion.md`
- **Structure**: $1,000/month for up to 50 brands with 12-month commitment
- **Includes**: Unlimited AI credits until Black Friday + segmentation across all brands
- **Economics**: 50 brands cost ~$50/month in segmentation, net positive after Stripe fees
- **Key Insight**: Segmentation is key value proposition, unlimited credits create urgency

#### 2. Agency Essentials Usage-Based Model  
**Source**: `/datasets/product/epics/2025/EPIC_launch-agency-credit-based-pricing-model.md`
- **Structure**: $399/month, unlimited brands (≤25), 750 message credits pooled
- **Pricing**: Tiered overage bundles ($20/50 msgs, $30/100 msgs, $50/200 msgs)
- **Economics**: 70-94% gross margins across usage scenarios
- **Evolution**: Shifted from token-based to message-based credits for customer clarity

#### 3. Platform Usage Analysis & Cost Structure
**Source**: `/datasets/research/sources/pricing-strategy/2025-08-11_usage-analysis_raleon-platform-costs-and-consumption.md`
- **Message Costs**: ~$0.06 per message (17k tokens median)
- **Usage Variance**: 300x difference between light/heavy users ($0.12-$30.62 per chat)
- **Brand Patterns**: 1-35 chats per month per brand, 20% are high-activity users
- **Agency vs Brand**: Agency sessions 1.6x more token-intensive than platform average

#### 4. Message-Level Token Analysis
**Source**: `/datasets/research/sources/pricing-strategy/2025-08-18_process-analysis_message-level-token-usage-pricing-model.md`
- **Statistical Foundation**: Analysis of 7,392 messages across 181 brands
- **Cost Distribution**: Median 17k tokens/message, range 1k-140k tokens
- **Customer Patterns**: Median 9 messages/brand/month (includes inactive users)
- **Engaged Usage**: 30-60 messages/brand/month expected with improvements

### Internal Strategic Context

#### 5. Black Friday Strategy Meeting
**Source**: `/datasets/meetings/Internal/Strategy/2025/2025-08-14_strategy_agency-plan-pricing-and-black-friday-promotion-strategy_strategy_jay.md`
- **Strategic Timing**: Black Friday anchoring more effective than end-of-year
- **Promotional Structure**: Struck-through credits with "Unlimited until Black Friday" messaging  
- **Market Positioning**: Aggressive promotion to capture market during peak season
- **Implementation**: Next week priority after current feature releases

#### 6. Strategic Decision Memos
**Sources**: 
- `/datasets/strategy/memos/2025/08-18_agency-essentials-message-based-pricing-launch_v2.0.md`
- `/datasets/strategy/memos/2025/08-11_agency-essentials-usage-based-pricing-launch_v1.0.md`
- **Key Evolution**: Token-based → Message-based credits for customer comprehension
- **Margin Targets**: 70-85% gross margins sustainable across scenarios
- **Customer Value**: 50-85% savings vs current pricing drives adoption

## New Brand-Specific Context (Session Input)

### Brand Segmentation Cost Structure
- **Cost Range**: $0.50-$3.00 per day ($15-$90 per month)
- **Scaling Factor**: Linear correlation with order volume/annual sales
- **Small Brands ($1-5M sales)**: $15-45/month segmentation costs
- **Large Brands (~$140M sales)**: $90/month segmentation costs
- **Proposed Cap**: Consider limiting to brands under $10M annual sales

### Brand vs Agency Usage Differences
- **Agency Model**: Pooled credits across multiple client brands
- **Brand Model**: Concentrated usage on single brand (potentially higher intensity)
- **Value Proposition**: Must include email generation emphasis + segmentation
- **Commitment Structure**: Annual commitment model vs monthly flexibility

## Strategic Questions to Address

1. **Optimal Price Point**: What pricing balances customer value with margin protection?
2. **Sales Cap Threshold**: Is $10M the right cutoff, or should it be $5M/$15M/$20M?
3. **Inclusion vs Add-on**: Should segmentation be included or offered as add-on?
4. **Usage Limits**: Truly unlimited or soft caps with overage pricing?
5. **Commitment Terms**: 12-month commitment like agency model or different terms?
6. **Competitive Positioning**: How does this compare to current brand pricing and market alternatives?

## Knowledge Gaps Identified

1. **Current Brand Pricing**: Need baseline of existing brand plan pricing for comparison
2. **Brand Usage Patterns**: More granular data on individual brand usage vs agency pooled usage
3. **Competitive Landscape**: How do competitors price similar bundles for individual brands?
4. **Customer Willingness-to-Pay**: Research on brand customer price sensitivity
5. **Seasonal Impact**: How does Black Friday timing affect brand customer decision-making?

## Context Quality Assessment
**Completeness**: High - comprehensive unit economics and agency model precedent  
**Currency**: High - most recent data from August 2025  
**Relevance**: High - direct applicability of agency model to brand structure  
**Depth**: Medium-High - detailed cost structure but limited brand-specific behavioral data
