# Decision Framework: Value-Based Pricing with Unit Economics Analysis

**Framework Selected**: Value-Based Pricing + Unit Economics Optimization  
**Decision Context**: Brand Black Friday unlimited plan pricing strategy  
**Objective**: Determine optimal pricing structure that maximizes customer value while maintaining sustainable margins

## Framework Components

### 1. Customer Value Identification
**Question**: What value do individual brands derive from unlimited AI + segmentation bundle?

**Key Value Drivers to Analyze**:
- **Unlimited AI Messages**: Removal of usage anxiety, ability to iterate extensively on campaigns
- **Email Generation Inclusion**: Complete campaign creation workflow, significant time savings
- **Segmentation Included**: Advanced targeting capabilities typically priced as premium add-on
- **Black Friday Timing**: Peak season value when campaign optimization is most critical
- **Cost Reduction**: Dramatic savings vs current per-usage pricing

**Value Quantification Approach**:
- Calculate time savings from unlimited usage vs metered constraints
- Estimate revenue impact from better segmentation and campaign optimization
- Benchmark against current brand spending on email/segmentation tools
- Factor in Black Friday campaign value multiplier

### 2. Cost Structure Analysis (Unit Economics Foundation)
**Question**: What are our true costs for delivering this value to individual brands?

**Cost Components**:
- **Message Costs**: $0.06 per message × expected monthly usage
- **Segmentation Costs**: $15-90/month based on brand size (annual sales correlation)
- **Infrastructure**: Marginal costs for unlimited vs metered access
- **Support**: Customer success costs for promotional pricing

**Usage Pattern Modeling**:
- **Light Users**: 1-10 messages/month (current median: 9 messages/month)
- **Typical Users**: 30-50 messages/month (engaged usage expectation)
- **Heavy Users**: 60+ messages/month (power users, 20% of customer base)

**Cost Scenarios by Brand Size**:
- **Small ($1-5M sales)**: $15-45/month segmentation + message costs
- **Medium ($5-10M sales)**: $45-70/month segmentation + message costs  
- **Large ($10M+ sales)**: $70-90/month segmentation + message costs

### 3. Competitive Alternative Analysis
**Question**: What alternatives do brands have and how should we position against them?

**Direct Competitors**:
- Current Raleon per-message pricing (baseline comparison)
- Klaviyo + segmentation tools (separate tool stack)
- Other AI email/marketing platforms

**Indirect Competitors**:
- Hiring additional marketing staff for campaign creation
- Freelance/agency services for email campaign development
- DIY approach with basic tools

**Competitive Positioning Framework**:
- **Value**: All-in-one unlimited vs piecemeal solutions
- **Timing**: Black Friday urgency vs ongoing subscription
- **Cost**: Promotional savings vs regular pricing
- **Capabilities**: AI + segmentation vs basic email tools

### 4. Price Sensitivity & Willingness-to-Pay Assessment  
**Question**: What price points maximize adoption while protecting margins?

**Customer Segments to Analyze**:
- **Small DTC Brands ($1-3M)**: Price-sensitive, value-focused
- **Growing DTC Brands ($3-7M)**: Scaling rapidly, willing to pay for growth tools  
- **Established DTC Brands ($7-10M)**: Resource-constrained but revenue-generating

**Pricing Psychology Factors**:
- **Promotional Framing**: Struck-through regular pricing vs promotional rate
- **Commitment**: Annual commitment trade-off for better pricing
- **Bundling**: All-inclusive vs add-on pricing perceptions
- **Seasonal**: Black Friday urgency vs ongoing value

### 5. Margin Protection & Financial Sustainability
**Question**: How do we ensure healthy unit economics across different usage scenarios?

**Margin Targets**:
- **Minimum**: 70% gross margin (based on agency model precedent)
- **Target**: 80-90% gross margin for promotional sustainability
- **Risk**: Usage scenarios that could erode margins

**Financial Modeling Scenarios**:
- **Best Case**: Light usage, small segmentation costs
- **Expected Case**: Typical usage patterns with medium segmentation costs
- **Worst Case**: Heavy usage with maximum segmentation costs
- **Abuse Case**: Extreme usage requiring intervention/limits

### 6. Strategic Option Generation
**Question**: What pricing structures best balance customer value and business sustainability?

**Pricing Model Options to Evaluate**:

**Option A: Fixed Bundle Pricing**
- Single price point with unlimited usage + segmentation included
- Annual commitment requirement for promotional rate
- Simple, clear value proposition

**Option B: Tiered by Brand Size**  
- Different pricing based on annual sales thresholds
- Reflects segmentation cost differences
- More complex but cost-aligned

**Option C: Base + Add-on Model**
- Lower base price with segmentation as optional add-on
- Appeals to price-sensitive customers
- May reduce overall value perception

**Option D: Limited-Time Promotion**
- Deep discount until Black Friday, then regular pricing
- Creates urgency but may set wrong expectations
- Revenue risk if customers churn post-promotion

### 7. Implementation & Risk Assessment
**Question**: How do we execute this pricing strategy while managing operational risks?

**Implementation Considerations**:
- **Eligibility Verification**: How to validate annual sales thresholds
- **System Changes**: Billing system updates for new pricing structure
- **Customer Communication**: How to message this vs existing pricing
- **Timeline**: Launch coordination with Black Friday marketing

**Risk Mitigation Strategies**:
- **Usage Monitoring**: Early warning systems for cost overruns
- **Abuse Prevention**: Fair use policies and intervention triggers
- **Margin Protection**: Automatic pricing adjustments if costs exceed targets
- **Customer Success**: Proactive engagement to maximize value realization

## Framework Application Process

### Phase 1: Value & Cost Quantification
1. Model customer value scenarios by brand size and usage pattern
2. Calculate unit costs for each customer segment
3. Establish margin requirements and pricing constraints

### Phase 2: Competitive Positioning
1. Benchmark against current pricing and competitive alternatives  
2. Define unique value proposition and differentiation
3. Assess price sensitivity by customer segment

### Phase 3: Strategic Option Analysis
1. Generate 3-4 distinct pricing structure options
2. Model financial outcomes for each option across scenarios
3. Evaluate pros/cons and implementation complexity

### Phase 4: Recommendation & Implementation
1. Select optimal pricing approach with clear rationale
2. Define implementation timeline and requirements
3. Establish success metrics and monitoring plan
