## Template Usage Guidelines

### Core Philosophy
- **Conciseness over verbosity** - every section should be essential to the decision
- **Data-driven claims** - assertions should link back to processed research sources  
- **Clear recommendations** - what specifically are we deciding to do?
- **No implementation planning** - strategy decisions, not project management

### Section Selection Guide

**Always Include:**
- Problem Statement
- Key Evidence & Analysis  
- Recommendation
- Risk Management
- Sources & Citations

**Include When Relevant:**
- **Economic Impact Analysis** → pricing, investment, cost decisions
- **Customer/Market Scenarios** → user-facing decisions, market moves
- **Competitive Implications** → positioning, competitive response decisions
- **Technical Requirements** → product, platform, integration decisions

### Quality Warning Flags
- Unsupported projections or speculation
- Missing economic analysis for pricing/cost decisions
- Vague recommendations without clear next steps
- Implementation details in strategy memo
- Excessive background/context vs. decision content
